Our Thursday featured cat is Fifa! This cute heart really wants to be your newest furry companion. She is less than 2 yrs old and loves to play and rub on legs. We recommend that she be the only cat in a household as that's what will be most comfortable for her. Contact info@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet her! We will set up an appointment for you at the Caf√© with one of our adoption coordinators.
