This beautiful tuxedo lady is Tiny, she's one of our Café Cats available for adoption. She's 1-2 yrs old and arrived at Oakland Animal Services in June. She is a complete lovebug and even lets people rub her belly. She is great with other cats and dogs. She would make a wonderful addition to any household. Contact info@cattownoakland.org to set up an appointment to meet her at the Café!
