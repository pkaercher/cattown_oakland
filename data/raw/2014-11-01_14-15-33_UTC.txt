Amber told us a scary story last night... It was about how all our reservations for this weekend were FULL and we won't have any space for walk-ins! Guarantee your entry to the Cat Zone next weekend at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations or stop by Wed. - Fri. when we're less busy. And as always, if you're interested in adopting any of our cafe or foster cats please e-mail info@cattownoakland.org, happy caturday!
