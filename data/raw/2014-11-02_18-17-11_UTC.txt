Good morning from the newest member of the cat zone, Matisse! Since we had two adopted and taken home yesterday and this guy was so sociable at the shelter we decided to give him a shot in the CZ. He's doing amazingly well. He's about 6/7 months old and is a zooming ball of energy. To set up a meeting with this crazy fella send an email to info@cattownoakland.org ðŸ’š
