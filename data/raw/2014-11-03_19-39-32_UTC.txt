We are elated to announce the adoptions we had over the weekend. Four lucky cats found forever homes. Hank, Jasmine, Glynda, and Coleman! This makes 10 adoptions since we opened just over a week ago. Thank you all for your amazing support! More four legged furry friends will be arriving at the café today, come meet them when we reopen on Wednesday! 😻🐾💕
