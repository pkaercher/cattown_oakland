The good news? We've got a toaster for our bagels! The bad news? Our reservations for the Cat Zone this weekend are all booked up! We'll have a small stand-by list for no shows, or you can guarantee your entry at a later date by making a donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations. Happy Caturday!
