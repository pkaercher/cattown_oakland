Olivia the cat meets Olivia the pillow (by @sjeanetteclark)! Olivia is in the Cat Town foster-program and we can't believe she hasn't been adopted yet. But maybe this week is her week! If you're interested in bringing this verrry friendly and playful cat into your home e-mail info@cattownoakland.org!
