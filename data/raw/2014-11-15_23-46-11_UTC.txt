Meet Morris and Winchester! This brother/sister combo came from our friends at Feral Change and are a bit shy here in the cafe, but they are RIDICULOUSLY sweet. We'd love for them to find a foster (or permanent!) home together this weekend. If you're interested in meeting these two sweet hearts, please drop us a line at info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
