James is adoption No. 24! We also had a bunch of cats go to foster-to-adopt situations (because the families had cats and/or dogs), and now the Cat Zone is EMPTY! We couldn't be happier with how adoptions are going, and we'll be bringing in a whole new batch of cats from OAS tomorrow and Tuesday, thanks for another great week from all of us at Cat Town!
