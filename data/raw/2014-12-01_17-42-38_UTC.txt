Big thanks to Ruben and Caroline (Fifa's new humans) for making this awesome Chinatown inspired perch for the cafe! We're closed for cleaning and introducing a few new cats into the space today, but if you're interested in adopting a new four legged friend (including Daisy seen here), drop us a line at info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
