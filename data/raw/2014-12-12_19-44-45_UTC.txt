Super shy siblings and former cafe cats, Winchester and Morris, are just starting to come out of their shells. After hiding under a dresser for the better part of two weeks, they are now out cuddling on the bed. But, we need to move them this evening to a quiet spot where they can continue to build their confidence. They are about 10 months old and as sweet as can be. E-mail info@cattownoakland.org if you can foster (or adopt!) these wonderful siblings, plus we provide supplies and vet trips for all of our fosters >^. .^<
