Just got word that a few of our cats that have been in foster-to-adopt homes (Smidge, pictured here, and Hope) are being adopted. That makes adoption No. 50 and 51 from the cafe! We've got a handful of spaces left in the 6 o'clock hour today and tomorrow, so if you're interested in adopting, we suggest snagging those spots at www.cattowncafe.com, and your reservation donation can then be applied to the adoption fee... Happy Caturday!
