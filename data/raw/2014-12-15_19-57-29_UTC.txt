IG world, meet Praline. This sweet, wise lady is about 12 years old and is in need of a foster home asap. She tried out the cafÃ© and it wasn't her style. She is a total lovebug snuggler, but only with humans. She needs to be the only cat in a quiet home. We provide all the supplies you need! Better yet, you could adopt her ðŸ˜º Thanks to Maddie's Fund her adoption fee is waived and Cat Town will cover her medical bills for life. If you'd like to help this lovebug email us: info@cattownoakland.org
