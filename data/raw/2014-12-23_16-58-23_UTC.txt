This photo doesn't do it justice, but one of our volunteers brought in this awesome pop-up catmas card over the weekend! Just a reminder that we're closed until the 26th, and if you're interested in visiting us this weekend, we recommend making a reservation at www.cattowncafe.com, Cat Zone spots are just about filled up for this weekend and free walk-in space will be limited >^. .^<
