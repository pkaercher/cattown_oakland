Say hello to Knox! This beautiful dark orange guy just arrived at the café on Monday and he settled in immediately. He's between 1 and 2 years old and absolutely adores head rubs and making biscuits. Send us an email if you'd like to meet this guy! info@cattownoakland.org or stop by on Friday when we reopen ❤🐾😻
