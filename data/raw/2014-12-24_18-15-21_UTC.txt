Just another reminder that we're closed today and tomorrow, but will reopen on Friday the 26th! You can guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone by making a donation to Cat Town at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations. The reservation fees go towards feeding and caring for our cats and keeping a roof over their heads!
