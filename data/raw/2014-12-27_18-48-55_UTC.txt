This sleeping beauty is Atticus. He is probably the tallest cat you'll ever meet and *may* also be the sweetest. He's at the caf√© with his sister, Angelina, who looks a lot like her brother but is very shy. Send us an email if you'd like to make an appointment to meet them! info@cattownoakland.org
