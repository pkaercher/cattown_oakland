Good end to the week with Murphy (who has been in foster-to-adopt) and Dexter (who was brought in on Monday) getting adopted, bringing us to 73 adoptions! Thanks to everyone who came by this weekend, we'll be open again on the 31st from 8AM - 5PM, closed the 1st, then open for normal hours again on the 2nd >^. .^<
