Hearing these success stories never gets old for us. This is an update from Lionel's new family, "He's a fantastic cat with a quiet meow and a loud purr, rather given to being underfoot, loves hanging out with us and is a natural lap-cat. We're all very happy with one another." If you'd like to find your next true love come visit us, we love to play matchmaker ‚ù§ #catcafe #cattownoakland #Oakland #adopt
