We spent some time at Oakland Animal Services today to see if there were any cats there ready to come to the cafÃ©. We found a few, including this beautiful nameless lady. Unfortunately, many of the cats there are not fit for the cafÃ© life (i.e. They are not good with other cats, they are extremely fearful, they are sick, etc.). We reopen tomorrow for regular business hours. Come meet your new furry soul mate ðŸ˜Š www.cattowncafe.com/reservations (we are full tomorrow but have some openings on the weekend)
