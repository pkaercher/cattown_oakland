Thanks to everyone who brought or sent in a shirt for #30CatShirtsIn30Days I made it to 56 days of different cat shirts! Now we'll hit restart, and post a new piece of cat clothes from all our staff, volunteers, and YOU the patrons everyday we're open. So make sure you wear your most awesome cat clothing when you visit us >^. .^<
