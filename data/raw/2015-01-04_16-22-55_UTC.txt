Met a TON of new cats that'll be making their way to our cafe and foster programs from Oakland Animal Services and Feral Change yesterday! We're closed Monday and Tuesday so our volunteers can help acclimate the new cats and get them comfortable in the cafe before meeting the public. if you'd like to help (by fostering, volunteering, or delivering of supplies/cats), e-mail volunteer@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
