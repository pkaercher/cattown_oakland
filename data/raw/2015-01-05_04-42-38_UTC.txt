Had a lot of foster-to-adopts today at the cafe (Bonzai & Buckaroo plus Dublin & Watson!) but Gracie here is still available for adoption! We're closed the next two days to introduce new cats to the Cat Zone, but if you're interested in adopting from us then drop us a line at info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
