It's a little hard to believe with this picture that Negroni basically grew up in the shelter. He arrived at only 2 mos old and spent 6 mos there before coming to the café. He was so terrified at the shelter that only one person could interact with him, and only in a limited way. We so desperately wanted him to find a loving home so we took a chance and brought him to the café. In just over a week we saw a huge transformation; he was letting everyone pet him and was loving it. He also loves to cuddle with any cat that lays near him. Email us if you'd like to meet him! info@cattownoakland.org
