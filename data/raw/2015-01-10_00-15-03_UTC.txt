Can you help out young Mario? He doesn't seem to be adjusting well to the life here at cafe, so were taking him to the vet for a quick check up, and hoping to find a foster home for him to land in. If you've got room in your home please drop us a line at info@cattownoakland.org, we'll supply you with food, litter, and toys if you can provide a loving space for him >^. .^<
