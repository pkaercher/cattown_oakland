Tucker here is somehow still in the Cat Zone! This beautiful black cat has an amazing smoky gray undercoat, is aprox. 7 months old, and was part of a colony near Highland Hospital. He was brought to us via Feral Change, and we can't wait for him to find his new family! If you're interested in meeting him during our closed days e-mail us at info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
