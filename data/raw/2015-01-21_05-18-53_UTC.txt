Chester here was going to be part of this weeks cafe crew, but we just found out that he's FIV+ and needs to head to a foster home ASAP! If you've never fostered before but have been thinking about it, he'd be a great starter cat! Sweet and mellow as can be, and Cat Town will cover all vet visits and supplies during his stay. Please e-mail info@cattownoakland.org if you can help >^. .^<
