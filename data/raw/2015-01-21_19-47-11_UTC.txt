Ruben here has been in Foster-To-Adopt for a couple weeks and we got word over the weekend that they wanted to make it official... The paperwork has been filed and Ruben makes adoption No. 99! Looking like we'll hit our 100th adoption before our 3 month anniversary on 1/25/15, meaning we're adopting more than a cat a day >^. .^<
