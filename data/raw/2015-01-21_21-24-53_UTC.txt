Theo here was born under an abandoned house on 33rd street, rescued by our friends at @feralchange, and is now in the Cat Zone ready to be adopted! You can usually find him in the bridge between the Federal Towers, or in one of the cubbies of our new train station in the quite room. Drop us a line at info@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet this sweet dude >^. .^<
