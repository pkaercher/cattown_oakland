Rita & Dominique were trapped as older kittens by in West Oakland after Feral Change received a call from an older disabled man who needed help fixing the cats that lived in his backyard. Rita and Dominique were tough kittens to socialize, but have blossomed into very sweet cats, although still on the shy side.Â  They're looking for a patient home that will allow them time to get used to their new surroundings, if this sounds like you, send us an e-mail to info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
