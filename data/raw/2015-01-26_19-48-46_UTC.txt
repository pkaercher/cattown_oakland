We took little Penny here from OAS back in August. She was in pretty rough shape, but thanks to  Tracy G., she's been fostered back to good health and will be making her way to the cafe this week! As always, if you're interested in adopting from us, please e-mail info@cattownoakland.org and we'll set up a time either in the cafe, or at one of our foster homes to introduce you to our cats!
