We had quite a Sunday! Beau, Bailey, Gemma, Sydney, and Dixie all found homes this weekend too... Bringing our adoption count to 111 cats in the 3 months we've been open! It was just over a year ago that Ann and I started this crazy venture, and we wouldn't be here without the amazing support of our volunteers, staff, and the community of Oakland (and beyond!), so thank you! >^. .^<
