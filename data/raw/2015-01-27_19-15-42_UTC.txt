Meet Max, he's the mostly black cat with the perma-flipped ear! He came to us from the @ninelivesfoundation last Friday, and mostly stayed in our Quiet Zone throughout the weekend, but was happy to let people pet him and purred up a storm. If you'd like to meet him, drop us a line at info@cattownoakland.org or make a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations to visit him, and all our cafe cats >^. .^<
