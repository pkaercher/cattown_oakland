Topher here was only at OAS for about a week, but was going stir crazy in his cage. He's adjust so well to the cafe, and is so confident and playful! He won't be here long, so come visit us when we open the Cat Zone up at 10AM tomorrow, and e-mail us at info@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in adopting this amazing guy >^. .^<
