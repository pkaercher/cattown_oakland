Jasper is as sweet as can be, but is still a little shy. You'll likely find him hanging out in the tuna can bed, or in our quiet room when we open the Cat Zone for the week at 10AM. Weekend reservations are filling up fast, so snag your spots at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations and know that your $$$ is supporting a great non-profit cat rescue, and the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA >^. .^<
