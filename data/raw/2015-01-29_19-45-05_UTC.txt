Ginger and Spice are 5-6 months old and came to us after a resident contacted Feral Change about kittens left behind after their mother was hit by a car. Now they're here warming up to life in the cafe and looking for a home together! E-mail us at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet these beautiful ladies >^. .^<
