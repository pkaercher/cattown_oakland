It's hard to believe that it's already been a year since we launched our campaign to open America's 1st cat cafe, and somehow we're here... 3 months after opening, with 111 cats adopted and about another  dozen in foster-to-adopt homes! It's been a heck of a ride, and we've got a lot of great new ideas and projects that we'll be announcing soon. We are both SO grateful for all the support we've gotten from our volunteers, staff, vendors, artists, and all of YOU, and we can't wait to see where the rest of the year takes us! - Ann and the Cat Man >^. .^<
