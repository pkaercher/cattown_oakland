Prior to coming to the cafe, Echo had been at the Nine Lives Foundation for over a year and a half. Now he's giving the Cat Zone a shot, and will hopefully find a forever home this weekend! Reservations are all full for tomorrow, but there's still a few spots left on Sunday! Make your reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations and drop us a line at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet Echo >^. .^<
