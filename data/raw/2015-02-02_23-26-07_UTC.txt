Had quite a few cats go to foster-to-adopt homes this week, but these beautiful guys and gals are all still here and available for adoption! Meet (From L to R, top to bottom) Max, Echo, Margaret, Jeremy, Blake, Gary, Maggie, Ginger & Spice, and Luca! If you're interested in meeting any of these amazing cats, e-mail us at cafe@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
