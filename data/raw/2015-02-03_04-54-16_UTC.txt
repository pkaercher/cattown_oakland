How could I forget about Mimi?! She's also one of the sweet cats available for adoption from the cafe that came from Contra Costa Animal Services. Our team brought in another 8 cats (6 from OAS, 1 from Feral Change, and 1 from CCAS) today, making 19 cats that we'll have when we open on Wednesday! If you're interested in adopting, drop us a line at cafe@cattownoakland.org to make an appointment, or see all the cats available in our foster program at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
