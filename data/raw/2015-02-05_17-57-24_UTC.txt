T-minus 5 minutes before we open the Cat Zone for the day, and you have a chance to come meet Willis! He spent about 6 weeks in OAS before we sprung him and brought him here to the cafe! He's got a lot of good playful energy, and would do great in a home with kids. Stop by 2869 Broadway from 10AM - 7PM or drop us a line at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet him >^. .^<
