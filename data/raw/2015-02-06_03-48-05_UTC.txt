Willis here had quite a day! We're excited to share that he became adoption No. 114 just after being in the Cat Zone for 2 days. Thanks to everyone who visited today, we've still got a few open reservations for this weekend, and Valentine's Day weekend is filling up too! So make your reservation-donation and guarantee your entry into our Cat Zone at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
