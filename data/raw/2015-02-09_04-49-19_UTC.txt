Ginger here is exhausted after a long week in the Cat Zone! Huge thanks to everyone who came in and supported us this week. We've got new art, some new food, and of course more cats coming in the next few days, so stay tuned, and guarantee your entry into the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
