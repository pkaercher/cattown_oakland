Echo here is SUCH a sweet cat, and quick to purr when pet. He started his stay at the Nine Lives Foundation when he was just 6 weeks old, and was there for about a year and a half before moving him here to Oakland and into the cafe. If you've never had a cat before, he'd be a great first! Drop us a line at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to give this sweet dude a permanent home >^. .^<
