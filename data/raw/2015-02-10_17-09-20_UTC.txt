Here are our current cafe cats that are all still looking for a home: (From top to bottom, left to right) Minuet, Ginger, Spice, Jeremy, Echo, Gary, Talulah, Reginald, and Blake. We're closed today, but if you're interested in adopting any of these wonderful cats, shoot us an e-mail to cafe@cattownoakland.org and we'll schedule a time for you to come meet the gang >^. .^<
