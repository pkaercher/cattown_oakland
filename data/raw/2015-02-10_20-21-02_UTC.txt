Cafe staffer Kyle found Waffle here after being chased up a tree by a bunch of loose dogs, and our friends at Feral Change took him in to get fixed/vaccinated/microchipped and now we're giving him a chance to find a home at the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! Shoot us an e-mail (cafe@cattownoakland.org) or pay us a visit at 2869 Broadway when we open again tomorrow at 10AM >^. .^<
