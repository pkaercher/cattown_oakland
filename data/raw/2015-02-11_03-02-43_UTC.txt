Waffle was in the cafe for less than 24 hours before getting adopted, making him Adoption No. 117! Come visit the 1st cat cafe in the USA when we open the Cat Zone tomorrow morning at 10AM with 19 cats. Weekend reservations are just about full too, so snag your spots by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com >^. .^<
