Our next artist (@sjeanetteclark) hung up some of her show in the gallery tonight! Come by this week and get a sneak peek of her work, or come to the opening celebration on Saturday from 12PM - 4PM where we'll be debuting the coloring book she made for us! Plus #cupcakecaturday, meowmosas, and a few more fun surprises >^. .^<
