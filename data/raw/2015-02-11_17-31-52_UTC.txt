Bambi (a former hoodkitten) is one of four @hoodcats in the cafe right now. They've been in the Cat Town Foster program for a couple of months and it's about time we find them a home, so we're giving them a shot in the cafe! We open the Cat Zone at 10, so come meet all of our wonderful cats at 2869 Broadway in Oakland, CA >^. .^<
