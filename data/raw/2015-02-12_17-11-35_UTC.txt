Kiana and Reginald are ready for the Cat Zone to open, and find their forever homes! This weekends reservations are already fully booked, but we've got plenty of space for walk-ins today and tomorrow! However, you can guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone, and support our cat rescue efforts, by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations! We (humans and cats) really appreciate your support >^. .^<
