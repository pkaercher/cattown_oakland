Here's a couple of pages from the "No Claws For Alarm" coloring book that our new resident artist Sarah Clark made for her up coming show! We're hosting a gallery opening party this Saturday from 12PM - 4PM where we'll have a table and crayons set-up with pages for you to color, meowmosas, and of course #CupcakeCaturday!
