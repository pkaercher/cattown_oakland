Laurel made it through her first week here at the Cat Town Cafe, but we have a good feeling we'll find her a permanent this week! The Cat Zone opens at 10AM today, and reservations for Saturday and Sunday are filling up fast! Make a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations to guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone at the only non-profit cat cafe in the USA >^. .^<
