We brought Reuben to the Cat Town Cafe after he'd been at the Oakland shelter for almost 7 weeks. He found his stay in the cafe to be only marginally better, and was pretty overwhelmed. Thankfully, we have a great foster program and were able to get Reuben someplace comfy while he waited for a permanent home. He was adopted quickly and is now so confident that we hardly recognize him! Thanks to Erin and Ryan for fostering him in a pinch, and to Katherine and Sean for giving him a great home. If you'd like to volunteer or foster for us, don't hesitate to e-mail volunteer@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
