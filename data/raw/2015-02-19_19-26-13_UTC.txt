Baby was surrendered to OAS last June with her sister Tiny, and they sat in the shelter for over four months. We decided they'd be great cats to try out at the cafe, but after a few weeks, we could tell they were a little overstimulated by all the attention. Thankfully, we have an amazing network of homes via our foster program, and were able to get them to a much more quiet space. Now we're happy to report they've been adopted! Baby here was adopted by our cafe manager Stephanie H. and makes adoption No. 128! We've got quite a few other cats that have been in foster-to-adopt homes that we'll be posting about this week, so stay tuned >^. .^<
