Calvin here has been in the cafe for less than 2 days and just found his forever home. He makes adoption No. 129, and is getting picked up on Saturday! Make sure you come say hello and wish this guy luck before he heads home with his new family! And congrats to new Cat Zone Lead Gillian for facilitating her first adoption >^. .^<
