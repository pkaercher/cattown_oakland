Gene and Bambi (two former @hoodcats) caught snuggling under some blankets in the Cat Zone. They're both a little shy, but total sweethearts who are looking for their forever homes, so come meet them! We have a handful of spots still available for this weekend, so guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations and come see this cuteness yourself >^. .^<
