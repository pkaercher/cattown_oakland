Echo has officially been adopted (No. 132)! Here's what his new mom Lisa had to say, "The first night he stayed under my bed but did come out to eat and drink, and go to the bathroom. I was happy to know he felt comfortable enough to do all that when I was pretend sleeping. Yesterday, he came out when I called him at about 12pm and he's been the most lovable, sweetest gentleman!!! I have fallen in love." Echo had been in the cafe for about 3 weeks after being at the @ninelivesfoundation for a year and a half, so we're thrilled to have finally found him a permanent home!
