Miriam was hanging out in City Hall for a bit this morning! She came to us after a brief stay at OAS where she had a bad flea infestation (which is why she's a little patchy still!). She's all recovered now, and ready to find her forever home, so drop us a line at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet her >^. .^<
