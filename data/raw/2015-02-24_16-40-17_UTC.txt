Hey everyone! We've got a private party that's willing to donate $10,000 to us if we can match it... While we make saving cats seem fun and easy, it is hard and expensive work, and donations are desperately needed. Our primary source of funding was recently discontinued, so now our expenses are unsustainable without your support. If you're a fan of what we do, and want to see us to continue to empty the cages of OAS, please think about giving a one time, or monthly donation at bit.ly/10kmatch. Between the cafe and our foster program, we've adopted 89 cats since January 1st! You can help make 2015 our best year yet by helping us match our $10,000 goal at bit.ly/10kmatch >^. .^<
