Mochi here only had a few hours out in the Cat Zone this past week (we mainly kept her in our *new* space that we'll be talking about more soon...) and we're stoked to share that she's just become adoption No. 136 from the first Cat Cafe in the USA! We couldn't do what we do without your support, so if you enjoy seeing all these cats getting adopted, help us hit a new $10,000 fundraising goal at bit.ly/10kmatch >^. .^<
