We brought Jonathan (2 y/o gray) and Grover (2 y/o orange) to the Cafe after being at the Nine Lives Foundation for nearly two years. They haven't stopped purring since they got here, but have a small case of URI (which is easily treatable), and we're looking for a foster or foster-to-adopt home where they can get some well-deserved R&R! E-mail us at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet them >^. .^<
