Good morning from Twiggy! She's about 9 months old, is a little bit shy, but is as sweet as can be. You'll find her mostly in the Quiet Zone, but she's started venturing out more into the main space every day! Drop us a line at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet this beautiful little lady >^. .^<
