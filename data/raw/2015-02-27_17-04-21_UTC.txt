Lavendar came to us after being in OAS for over 3 months (nearly a quarter of her life)! She was initially very shy but has quickly come around, and is quite playful. That bottom photo is her laying/playing by herself in one of our toy bins in the Cat Zone! Want to meet her? E-mail us at cafe@cattownoakland.org, or drop by 2869 Broadway until 7PM tonight >^. .^<
