Patrick and Joy did a short stint in the cafe, but it was a bit to overwhelming for them, so we moved them into our foster program. Both are a little shy and are learning to trust. They're definitely coming out of their shell! Joy is gorgeous and sweet, nuzzling into cheek and chin scratches, while Patrick is wary of hands and getting into being pet. He likes to strut around the house when he thinks no one is watching. Both are 1-2 years old and will be playful and fun. We are hoping to place these two into a foster-to-adopt home for those willing to give them a legitimate chance to come into their own, and think that they should be in a home without small children.
