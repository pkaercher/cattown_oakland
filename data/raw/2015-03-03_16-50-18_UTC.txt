Twiggy here is about 9 months old, a little shy, but so sweet! She's recently started showing some signs of having a URI (basically a cat cold), so we've moved her next door, and are looking for a loving foster or foster-to-adopt home for her to recover at where she'll receive the love she deserves. If you've got room in your home for this sweet lady, shoot us an e-mail at cafe@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
