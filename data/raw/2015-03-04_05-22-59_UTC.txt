Rodney and Rodger spent most of their time with us in our new next-door space because they had ear mites and needed to be isolated, but we're happy to say they became adoption No. 139 and 140 tonight! We'll be opening the Cat Zone tomorrow morning at 10AM and you can guarantee your entry and support our rescue efforts by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
