Anyone have room in their home to foster Griffin? He was trapped on the streets of Oakland, and stayed at OAS for over 2 months before we pulled him, and give him a shot at the cafe. He's hasn't taken to the space all that well (we're thinking he's never lived indoors, and this was a bit of a shock to him) so we'd like to get him into a home with folks who can take the time to show him how good life can be indoors. If that sounds like you, shoot us an e-mail to cafe@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
