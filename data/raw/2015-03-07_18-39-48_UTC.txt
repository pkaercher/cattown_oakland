Today is #CupcakeCaturday and we've got gluten free chocolate and peanut butter cupcakes from our baker Rolling Sloane's! We just had two cancellations at 2PM and 6PM, and have a handful of spots still available tomorrow, so make a reservation-donation and guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
