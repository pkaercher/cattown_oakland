Here's Bambi enjoying her breakfast on this cloudy Tuesday morning. We're closed today, but will open the Cat Zone tomorrow at 10AM. This weekends spaces are filling up quick, so make your reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations and guarantee your entry into the first cat cafe in the USA, and support an awesome non-profit cat rescue >^. .^<
