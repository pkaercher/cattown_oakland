Mounds came to us from the Nine Lives Foundation after being there for nearly 2 1/2 years. We've had him in the cafe for just over a week, and are stoked to share that he just became adoption No. 145! You can help us find more cats like Mounds loving homes by  making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations and supporting our rescue efforts, we (humans and cats) really appreciate all the support >^. .^<
