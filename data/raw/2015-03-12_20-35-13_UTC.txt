Waffle has had quite a life! From being found living out on the streets by Kyle (one of our cafe employees), getting vaccinations and fixed by our friends at @feralchange, falling in looove with the cat-nip, and now getting adopted from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! That's 146 cats adopted since we opened on 10/25/14 >^. .^<
