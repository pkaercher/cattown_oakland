Peep loves our new cardboard Katris structure! Peep went home foster-to-adopt a few weeks ago, but after the dominant male cat of the house and little Peep didn't get along very well, she rejoined the ranks here at the cafe. If you're interested in meeting this spunky little lady, drop us a line at cafe@cattownoakland.org or visit the Cat Zone when from 10AM - 7PM Wednesday - Sunday >^. .^<
