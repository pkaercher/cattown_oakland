Amber (and her sister Libby) were adoption No. 13 and 14 back in November, but due to a severe allergic reaction by one of the members of their adopted home, had to come back to the cafe. The family was SO heartbroken to have to bring them back, they tried lots of different meds and inhalers, but nothing worked, so now these awesome sisters are back in the Cat Zone and looking for a permanent home. Reservations for Caturday are totally full, but you can still snag an hour in the Cat Zone today or Sunday by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations and, reservation donations can be applied towards your adoption fee >^. .^<
