Brought Ramona over to the cafe today to let her explore a bit. She was at OAS for nearly 3 months, then housed in a foster home for a couple of weeks before becoming a cafe cat! Come meet this beautiful lady this weekend, you can still make a reservation-donation for Sunday at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations, and your donation can be applied to the adoption fee >^. .^<
