Remember Patrick and Joy? They were in the cafe a few weeks ago for a couple of days, but it was a little too stimulating and overwhelming for them. Luckily, we were able to move them into our foster program, and we're so happy to see that they're coming out and getting comfortable... Unfortunately, they're now starting to stress out the resident house cat, and we're needing to move them to a (hopefully!) foster-to-adopt home in the next few days. If you're interested in meeting these two sweet cats, please e-mail us at info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
