Roswell is a sweet little 1.5 year old black cat, with a small patch of white on her chest. She came to the cafe after spending 10 months at the Nine Lives Foundation in Redwood City! She's still a little skittish around new folks, but is warming up to playing and being pet, and we're hoping to find her a home with another young cat that she can bond, play with, and learn from. Shoot us an e-mail at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet our resident ðŸ‘½ >^. .^<
