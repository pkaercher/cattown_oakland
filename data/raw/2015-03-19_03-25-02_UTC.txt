Wendell went to a foster to adopt home a few weeks ago, but will be back in the Cat Zone starting tomorrow! The family that wanted to adopt him have a dog who was less than stoked on his new brother, so we're giving him another go in the Cat Zone! Come meet him when we open back up tomorrow morning at 10AM >^. .^<
