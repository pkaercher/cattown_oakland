Cash was at the Nine Lives Foundation for just over a year before we brought him here to the cafe, and now we're excited to share that he became adoption No. 158 and left for his new home today! Just a note that the weekend reservation spots are just about full, so head to www.cattowncafe.com/reservations and guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone while supporting our rescue efforts >^. .^<
