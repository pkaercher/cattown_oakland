This is Moby, he's a senior and FIV+ cat that is super mellow and looking for his forever home via the Cat Town Cafe. He'd do fine in a home on his own, but also gets along great with other cats, so if you're looking to bring a big beautiful ginger into your life shoot us an e-mail at cafe@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
