Ariel came to us after being born on the streets of West Oakland (and is a former @hoodcats cat). Her and her 3 siblings went to a Cat Town foster home before coming here to the cafe to be adopted! Ariel and her siblings have made HUGE strides, and are becoming very cuddly and playful cats! Come meet her today until 7PM >^. .^<
