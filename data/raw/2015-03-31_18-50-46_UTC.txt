The cafe is closed today, but we got an awesome update on Jameson (he was adopted just before Valentines day), who looks like he's getting pretty comfortable in his new home with Richard and Linda! Reservations for this weekend are starting to fill up, so guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone and support the only non-profit cat cafe in the USA by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
