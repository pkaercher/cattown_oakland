Kiana was in a foster-to-adopt situation that didn't work out because the resident cat was too stressed by her presence... But, Kiana is extremely outgoing, loves attention, and has no problem climbing into anyones lap! Shoot us an e-mail at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet her >^. .^<
