Geneva and Stella are another bonded pair that we brought over from the Nine Lives Foundation a week ago. Both are quite shy, but are curious about people and get quite playful when they're comfortable! Come meet them for yourself at 2869 Broadway at the first cat cafe in the USA in Oakland, CA >^. .^<
