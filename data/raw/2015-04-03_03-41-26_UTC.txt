Bambi would like to remind everyone that tomorrow is #FreeCoffeeFriday thanks to our friends at @bicyclecoffee! Space in the Cat Zone is pretty full for tomorrow and this weekend, so guarantee your entry and help support the first (and only non-profit!) cat cafe in the USA by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
