You may remember Twiggy and Huey (now Bomber and Merle), who went to a foster-to-adopt home early last month. Their new mom came into the cafe today and made it official, making them adoption No. 161 & 162! We've still got a few spots open in the schedule on Saturday and Sunday, so make your reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations to guarantee entry into the Cat Zone and support our foster and adoption program >^. .^<
