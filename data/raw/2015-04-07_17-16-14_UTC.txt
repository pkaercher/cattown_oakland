The cafe is closed today, but did you know Cat Town started as a foster-based cat rescue in 2011, before opening the 1st cat cafe in the USA? 
We're starting a new "Foster Cat of the Week" feature every Tuesday, and Anise here is up first! She is an adorable, sweet, and cuddly British Short Hair, who is currently looking for her forever home. She’s pretty much perfect and would make an ideal ‘starter kitty’, so long as you’re willing to keep her on a diet. It seems she likes to overindulge a bit—but then again... who doesn’t?

Check out all of our cats in foster-care at www.cattownoakland.org and e-mail info@cattownoakland.org if you see anyone you'd like to meet >^. .^<
