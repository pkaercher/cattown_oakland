Maverick is another cat that came into the cafe from OAS this week. He is so outgoing and confident, and will crawl right into your lap and make himself at home...for hours. Come meet him when we open the Cat Zone tomorrow morning at 10AM! You can also make a reservation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservation and help support our rescue efforts and take care of our cats >^. .^<
