It's not officially on the menu yet, but we're trying out a new "Hoodcats Mocha" (hot chocolate, pour over coffee, and a little milk) recipe! Cat Zone reservations are pretty full today, and at about 50% for the weekend, so guarantee your entry to the Cat Zone by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations, and as always, if you're interested in adopting shoot us an e-mail to cafe@cattownoakland.org and we'll get you in the schedule at no charge >^. .^<
