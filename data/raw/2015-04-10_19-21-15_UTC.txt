Bruno (formerly Panther) had been at the Nine Lives Foundation for over seven years before coming into our care here at the cafe where he's spent the last couple of weeks charming folks and getting lots of love and attention. Now, we're happy to share that he's FINALLY found his forever home! That makes adoption No. 165 from the first cat cafe in the USA >^. .^<
