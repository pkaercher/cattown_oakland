Filbert is a former @hoodcats cat from the streets of West Oakland. This was was his reaction to being in our space, and his first time on a real bed. The cafe is closed today, but we'll be taking Filbert to the vet, and you can still support our rescue efforts by making a tax-deductible donation at bit.ly/CTCDonate or making a reservation-donation to visit the Cat Zone at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations, we really appreciate all the help >^. .^<
