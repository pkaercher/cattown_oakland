Foster Cat Of The Week: Chestnut here started his life with Cat Town in the cafe, despite being a bit stressed by all the activity, he was just as sweet and affectionate as can be and was adopted in no time. But, as it will happen from time-to-time, it just didn’t work out. Thankfully we have an awesome network of foster families and rather than stress him out at the cafe again, we were able to place him into a temporary home.

Here's what his foster family has to say about him! “Chestnut is an extremely people-oriented, cuddly lap cat that adores being pet and rubbing his head against your face like he's greeting another cat. He can sit on your lap with his quiet purr for hours, resting his head on your shoulder. He is a great companion and all-around great kitty. He prefers people to other cats, but he can gradually become accustomed to another mellow kitty if given enough time.” If you'd like to meet Chestnut or learn how you can become a Cat Town foster home, e-mail info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
