Starting our week off with some awesome news... "For the first quarter of this year, the live release rate for cats was 93% compared to 88% last year! Both years, this incredible number can be attributed in large part to our partnership with Cat Town who just keeps taking more and more cats from us -- please pass on the gratitude." - Rebecca Katz, Oakland Animal Services Director.

We couldn't do what we do without your support! You can help fund our rescue efforts at bit.ly/CTCDonate or by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
