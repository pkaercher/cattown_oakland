Kiana is another gal from OAS who found her forever home through us and was adopted yesterday during our 'closed' hours, making adoption No. 167! If you're ever interested in adopting from us, don't hesitate to e-mail us at cafe@cattownoakland.org, facilitating adoptions is our number one priority even when the cafe is closed >^. .^<
