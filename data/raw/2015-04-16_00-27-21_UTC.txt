This is Schnitzy... She's 18 and was recently surrendered to OAS... She's not an ideal candidate for the cafe, but if you'd be interested in adopting her, Cat Town would take care of her vet bills FOR LIFE! She is suuuper sweet and seems quite healthy, so if you've got an open home and heart, shoot us an e-mail to info@cattownoakland.org! We'd love to get this old lady out of a cage and into a home as soon as possible >^. .^< *UPDATE This lovely lady was adopted on 4/19 via Cat Town and OAS!*
