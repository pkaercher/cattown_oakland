Kicking off our weekend with some great news! Chex and Marbles came into the cafe via OAS and a woman working to fix and rehome a colony in her neighborhood. Chex has always been very playful, and it's been awesome to watch Marbles get comfortable and confident with people in the space... Now they make adoptions No. 168 & 169 from the first cat cafe in the USA >^. .^<
