Wanda is ready for Caturday! She's a one year old brown tabby who was part of a colony living behind OAS. She got trapped and spayed (hence the ear tip) but then volunteers at the shelter determined that while she was a little shy/hissy, she could be pet, and would make a great indoor cat with some work. So, our volunteers here have spent about a month getting her socialized in our neighbor space, and now she's looking for a home in the Cat Zone! Come meet her today from 10AM - 7PM >^. .^<
