Quick update on Schnitzy, the 18 year old we were hoping to find a home for... She's been adopted! Here's what her new mom had to say "She found herself a nest and is out exploring, eating, and getting lots of love! Despite her angry face she's actually a happy little purr box this morning." Thanks to everyone for sharing and sending her good vibes! We'll be paying her vet bills for the remainder of her life, and couldn't do it without your support, so visit bit.ly/CTCDonate if you'd like to support our rescue efforts, no amount is too small >^. .^<
