Did you know you can support Cat Town cats in our cafe and foster programs via our Amazon Wishlist? Head to bit.ly/ctcwishlist to check out things you can buy our cats, like this awesome PetFusion scratcher lounge. The cats in the cafe REALLY like them, but due to heavy use and sanitary reasons, we've got to replace them every couple of weeks. We (the humans and the cats) really appreciate the support >^. .^<
