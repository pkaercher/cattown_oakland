Hans is a former @Hoodcats cat that we rescued from the streets of West Oakland over a year ago. He's become one of our more long-term fosters, and we'd really love to find him a forever home soon! Some of his favorite past times include chasing his tail, watching and pawing at bird videos on-line, and kneading to show affection. He is FIV+ so we'd like to keep him indoors, and he's also looking for a home with no children. If that sounds like a cat you'd like to get to know, then shoot an e-mail to info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
