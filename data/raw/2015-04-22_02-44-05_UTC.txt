Photo of the week goes to Darryl B. who lives around the corner from the cafe, and snapped this late-night shot of our cats looking out into Oakland. Make sure you tag @cattowncafe and #cattowncafe in any shots you take while visiting, we open the Cat Zone for the week tomorrow morning at 10AM >^. .^<
