We have an urgent rehoming need for a sweet old lady in our foster program! Meet Dame Maggie Smith, she came into OAS as a 20 year old surrender... a shelter is no place for such an old and hurting cat! So, Cat Town got her to a vet and into a foster home! A visit uncovered a heart murmur and probable hyperthyroidism and her current home has a few other cats and a small dog (which she isn't a huge fan of) so we'd like to find her a new place! 
Here's a note from her current foster "She has no problems with using the litterbox and generally seems happy and comfortable, although she moves slowly and may have arthritis, she's still able to jump up onto the couch or a bed.  She even still likes to play with a toy on occasion!  She is not on any medication and her only requirements are being fed as much as she wants and a warm place to sleep." She is free to adopt and her vet care will be paid for by Cat Town for the remainder of her life. E-mail info@cattownoakland.org if you have room in your home to help >^. .^<
