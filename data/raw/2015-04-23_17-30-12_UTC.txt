Ya'll remember Hershey? He went foster-to-adopt a few weeks ago and we just got word that his new family wants to make it official! Here's what they had to say, "I am so incredibly appreciative of all you all have done to keep him safe and loved until I got the honor of doing the same. He really is the most loving, cantankerous, brilliant, goofy, hilarious, affectionate companion and we feel so blessed to have met him when we did. It's all due to YOU and your compatriots that this lifetime connection ever could occur, so thankyouthankyouthankyou, from the bottoms of our Hershey-loving hearts!" That's adoption No.170 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA >^. .^<
