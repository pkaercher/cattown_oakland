Lucy here is a 6 month old we brought over from OAS a couple weeks ago. She was pretty shut down at the shelter, so she's been getting socialized by our volunteers in our new space, and now she's in the Cat Zone looking for a home! Lucy is still a little shy when approached but loves to play and will purr when you pet her. Shoot us an e-mail at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet this sweet lady >^. .^<
