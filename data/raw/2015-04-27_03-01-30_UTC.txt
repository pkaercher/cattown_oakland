Wrapping up our week with another foster-to-adopt cat (Max, now Quinn), that's making the adoption official! Here's what Quinn's new humans had to say about him... "He's doing so well! He's very confident all over the house and with our big cat Hibiscus. he's a little shadow and will follow us everywhere (particularly Malcolm.) but when he's sleeping he knocks out hard and is like butter when you pet him." That makes adoption No. 172 from the Cat Town Cafe >^. .^<
