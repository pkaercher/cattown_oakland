This is Reggie in an intense play sesh with Rollo... Rollo and his mom Joy met Reggie on Friday, couldn't stop thinking about him and wanting to give him a proper permanent home over the weekend... So, they came back last night and made Reggie adoption No. 173 from the Cat Town Cafe! We're closed today, but if you're interested in any of the cats we've posted this past week, don't hesitate to drop us a line at cafe@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
