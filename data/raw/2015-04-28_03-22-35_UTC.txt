I showed Filbert a picture of himself while he was still out on the streets as a @hoodcats cat and this was his response... He'll be making his debut in the Cat Zone this week, and you can make a reservation to come play with him and the rest of our 21 adoptable cats and support our rescue efforts at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
