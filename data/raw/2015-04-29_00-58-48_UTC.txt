Foster of the Week: Ebony & Ivory started their life with Cat Town at the cafe, but after a couple weeks, they made it clear the cafe life wasn't for them. Thankfully we have our foster program, and we were able to get them into a home to decompress. Now we're looking for a permanent home that can take this inseparable gorgeous pair. 
Ivory, the more gregarious, is known to hang out on the couch with his foster mom most evenings and likes to groom her hair.

Ebony will greet her foster at the door, and follow her around the house like a shadow.
