We have another foster cat who needs to be moved before May 5th!

Kenny was surrendered to OAS incredibly sick and thin, it turns out he had moderate kidney disease. That didn't keep this guy from constantly trying to get the attention of shelter volunteers, or jumping into their lap when his cage was opened!

Enter Cat Town and his temporary foster-mom Penny (a Registered Vet Tech) who fostered him to see what his needs were. Turns out he is symptom-free and Penny says, "Kenny loves his special food (k/d) and his medication tastes like tuna, so he thinks it's a treat, so no big deal keeping him healthy. He is a total catnip head too!" Weâ€™d love to move this guy to a foster-to-adopt home, so contact info@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet him >^. .^<
