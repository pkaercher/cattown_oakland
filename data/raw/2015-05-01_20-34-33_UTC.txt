I guess Pilgrim didn't hear our "Don't pick up the cats" rule, because she jumped right up into Christyn's arms! Make your reservation for this weekend at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations to guarantee entry into the Cat Zone this weekend and meet Pilgrim the hugging cat! 
If you meet her and decide you can't live with out her (we wouldn't blame you...) your reservation-donation can be applied to the adoption fee >^. .^<
