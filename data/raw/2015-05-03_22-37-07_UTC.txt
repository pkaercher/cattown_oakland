Blake here left for a foster-to-adopt home about 9 weeks ago, she wasn't too fond of the other cat in the house so we weren't able to make it official. But, they tolerated each other enough for her to still live there while we searched for her permanent home, and she has finally found it! That makes cat No. 176 outta the Cat Town Cafe to be adopted since we opened in October >^. .^<
