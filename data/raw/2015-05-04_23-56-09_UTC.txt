We're closed today and tomorrow, but if you'd like to meet any of our adoptable cats you've seen this week you can always shoot us an e-mail at cafe@cattownoakland.org and schedule a visit while we're closed! Armando is a 10 month old Russian Blue who is waiting for his new home. He is a little shy but is very cat-oriented, so we're looking for someone who has another cat in their home for him to bond with >^. .^<
