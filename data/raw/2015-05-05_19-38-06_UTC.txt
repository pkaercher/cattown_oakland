If you visited us last week, you may have met Ollie in our 'Quiet Zone' at the cafe. He was a little shy, but loved being pet and eating treats... and we're happy to share that he was adopted yesterday afternoon (No. 179)! We're closed Mondays and Tuesdays, but if you're interested in adopting, don't hesitate to drop us a line at cafe@cattownoakland.org to schedule a special visit in our off hours >^. .^<
