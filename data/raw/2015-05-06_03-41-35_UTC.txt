Foster of the Week : Jackson is a spunky 1 to 2 year old male who loves being the center of attention.  He's intelligent, inquisitive, and prefers the type of play that gives lots of interaction with his humans! He would do beat with a family that understands active cats and would likely do best without kids. If you're interested in meeting him, e-mail info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
