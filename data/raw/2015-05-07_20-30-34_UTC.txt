Daisy is a 1.5 year old tabby from the 9 Lives Foundation. When she came to us a few weeks ago, she was very shy towards people. It's been awesome watching her transformation, as she's quite comfortable with playing and getting more accepting of being pet now. We're hoping to find her an experienced family that will give her time and patience to become the affectionate cat that we know she is. E-mail cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to set-up a time to meet Daisy >^. .^<
