We've got another cat in our foster program who needs to move ASAP! As you can see, Tyge was surrendered to the shelter in pretty rough shape... Cat Town pulled him, got him the medical attention he needed, and one of our amazing fosters nursed him back to good health. Now, he's looking for a new home! He does need an injection twice daily (which he takes like a champ), but he has turned into a very sweet and loving lap cat... and sometimes neck warmer! E-mail info@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in providing a home for Tyge >^. .^<
