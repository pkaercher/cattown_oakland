Armando is getting more and more comfortable with people everyday! He's a 10 month old Russian Blue that we've been working with in our new temporary space the last few weeks before we moved him into the Cat Zone... You can help us make our new space permanent by donating to Cat Town at bit.ly/cattownspc >^. .^<
