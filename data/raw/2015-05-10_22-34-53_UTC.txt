We're celebrating Mother's Day in a great way today! They don’t know it yet, but by dinnertime Charlotte (top, with three nearly invisible kittens) and Abigail and her brood will be out of the shelter.  No one wants to be in a cage, but it is especially hard on mom’s whose instincts tell them to keep their kittens safe and hidden. Taking these two families will cost at least $1,500 (for food, surgery, etc.). Supporting our Saving Pets Challenge campaign, and helping us win an extra $50K, will mean we can continue to get families like these right out of the shelter!
