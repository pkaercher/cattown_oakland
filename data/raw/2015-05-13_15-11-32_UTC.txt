Not only did we pull Shiloh from the shelter this week, but Charlotte, Charisse, Murphy, Asia, and India are out too (left to right top to bottom)! We couldn't help the amount of cats that we do without your support! You can help us by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations or donating to our new expansion project at bit.ly/cattownspc >^. .^<
