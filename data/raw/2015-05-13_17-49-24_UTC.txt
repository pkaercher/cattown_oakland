Foster cat of the week: Meet Scarlett, a 10 year old "torbie" (tortoise shell/tabby) with very unique eyes! She's very independent and doesn't mind her alone time, but will be ready to greet you at the door when you get home. She does have some mild kidney disease but is stable and not on any medication, and we'd prefer her to be the only cat of the house. If you're interested in meeting her, e-mail info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
