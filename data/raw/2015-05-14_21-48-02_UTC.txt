Meet Chauncey! He’s sitting in a cage at the Oakland shelter right now, recovering from a gnarly leg wound that was so severe that amputation has been considered. Saving his leg means that he needs a trip to the vet every other day or so, for about a month. The simple fact is that there isn’t another local rescue group that would take on such a challenging situation, but saving cats like Chauncey is our reason for being. He'll be headed to our new temporary space next door to the Cat Zone this evening, and you can help make it permanent by donating at bit.ly/cattownspc >^. .^<
