Cisco here is a 1.5 year old orange/white tabby who was at the 9 Lives Foundation for over a year. When we started socializing him he was pretty shy, but he's since gotten very playful and is coming out of his shell! Make a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations and come play with him this weekend >^. .^<
