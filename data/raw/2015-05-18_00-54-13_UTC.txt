This sweet lady was sooo friendly and begging to be let out of the cage. We're bringing her to the cafe now, and she'll be in the Cat Zone next week! If you like seeing all the cats we save, please donate to our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser that will help expand the Cat Zone at bit.ly/cattownspc, no amount is too little >^. .^<
