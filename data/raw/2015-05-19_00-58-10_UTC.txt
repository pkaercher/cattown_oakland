Griffin has been one of our longest term cats here at the cafe, but his wait is finally over! His mellow demeanor (and his rat friend) charmed a nice couple who came in today to take him home. He's going foster-to-adopt (since they've got another cat that they'll need to introduce him to), and we'll keep you updated with his progress >^. .^<
