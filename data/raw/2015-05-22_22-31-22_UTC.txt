May 30th and 31st is the big Maddie's Fund Pet Adoption Days weekend! Thanks to Maddie's Fund, Holly (seen here) and all the cats in our cafe and foster programs adoption fees will be waived, and Cat Town will get between $200 - $2,400 per adoption. If you've thought about adopting from us, next weekend is the perfect time! Visit the cafe next Wed. - Fri. to get prescreened, and check out all our cats available in our foster program at bit.ly/cattownfosters and email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more >^. .^<
