India and Asia are enjoying a Sunday afternoon nap in the Cat Zone! These two (and all our cats in the cafe and foster program) will have their adoption fee waived next weekend as part of the Maddie's Adoption Days! Check out all our cats in foster at bit.ly/cattownfosters or stop by the cafe next week to meet all of our cats >^. .^<
