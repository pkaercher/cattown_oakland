Got to spend some time with Chauncey after his latest trip to the vet to get his leg bandage changed. He's doing really well, but it's looking like they'll have to take his leg... He's off to a foster home now while we wait to decide what comes next. You can help us take care of more cats like Chauncey by donating to our Saving Pets Challenge campaign and funding our Cat Zone expansion at bit.ly/cattownspc >^. .^<
