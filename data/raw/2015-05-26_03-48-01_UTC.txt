Claude was preeeetty stoked when we told him we were getting him out of the shelter and into a foster-to-adopt home today! We pulled him plus another 8 cats for the cafe this week, which means we've got plenty of cats for the big Maddie's Adoption Days this weekend. We'll be pre-screening potential adopters all week, and only be making appointments on Saturday and Sunday for adopters (and accepting a limited amount of walk-ins). Plus, all of our adoption fees are waived and Cat Town gets special grant funding for every cat! E-mail cafe@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in adopting to learn more >^. .^<
