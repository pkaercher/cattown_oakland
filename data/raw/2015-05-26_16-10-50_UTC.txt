Scooter and Turner are two of the  eight new cats we brought into the cafe for the week! Come meet all 21 adoptable cats starting tomorrow, get screened for the adoption process, and take them home this weekend as part of Maddie's Adoption Days! All adoption fees will be waived, and we'll only be taking reservations for potential adopters (but letting in a limited number of walk-ins), email cafe@cattownoakland.org for more info >^. .^<
