Vanessa is a 1.5 year old Turkish Van who was very frightened and frozen during her 3 month stay at OAS. She's spent the last couple of weeks getting socialized in our new temporary space (that you can help fund at bit.ly/cattownspc!) and is ready for her own permanent home. She is very sensitive to loud noises and sudden movements, so we're hoping to find her a nice quiet home without young children or other animals. E-mail cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet her >^. .^<
