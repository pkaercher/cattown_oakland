Daphne was 1 of the 8 most recent cats we brought into the cafe from OAS this week, and she left for her new foster-to-adopt home last night! There's an old cat-friendly dog in the house, so we're making sure they like each other before her new mom commits! The Cat Zone opens at 10AM today, make a reservation-donation and help keep a roof over our cats heads at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
