This weekend is Maddie's Pet Adoption Days, which means all adoption fee's are waived and Cat Town gets special funding for every cat that gets adopted #ThanksToMaddie! We'll have 21 adoptable cats at 2869 Broadway, and if you come by tomorrow to get prescreened, it'll make your adoption process that much easier on Saturday. E-mail cafe@cattownoakland.org to learn more >^. .^<
