Here's the Cat Man and Edie, our sweet 16 year old lady cat who's looking for a lap for life. She's been in our new space the past few days (bit.ly/cattownspc),while we find her a permanent home. If you're looking for a loving and mellow lap cat, join us for Maddie's Adoption Weekend, where all fees are waived. See all the cats we have available at the cafe at bit.ly/ctcmaddiescats >^. .^<
