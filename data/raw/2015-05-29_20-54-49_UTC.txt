Ebony and Ivory are two former cafe cats, who moved over to our adoption program. For *THIS WEEKEND ONLY* all adoption fees are waived #ThanksToMaddie during the Maddie's Adoption Days. E-mail info@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to set-up a time to meet these amazing cats, and help Cat Town get some much needed grant funding >^. .^<
