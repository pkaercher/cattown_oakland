Turners level of excitement got really high when we told him he would probably get adopted this weekend... That or he just REALLY likes to play! Either way... come meet him today, and if you decide to take him home, his (and all our cats) adoption fees will be waived during Maddie's Adoption Days today and tomorrow >^. .^<
