Shiloh doesn't know it yet, but she just became our first adoption for Maddie's Pet Adoption Days! That's our volunteer Boris behind her going over paperwork with her new mom... That makes adoption No. 189 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA. Come meet the rest of our cats today until 6PM and all adoptions are *free* >^. .^<
