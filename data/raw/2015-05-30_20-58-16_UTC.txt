Adoption No. 190 and 191 are Julius (now Johnny) and Sushi who went FTA a few weeks ago to two of our cafe staff! We've still got 14 adoptable cats here in the cafe and welcome all potential adopters today and tomorrow until 6PM, and best of all, all adoption fees are waived #ThanksToMaddie >^. .^<
