Dip is a shy dude who has spends a decent amount of time in our Quiet Room, but if you go in and say hi, he will be quick to press into pets. Come meet and adopt him today [for free thanks to Maddie's Fund!] until 7PM. Not interested in adopting? You can still support our rescue by visiting the cafe or funding our expansion at bit.ly/cattownspc >^. .^<
