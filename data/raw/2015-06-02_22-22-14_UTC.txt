Neville, Mira, Chester, Shasta, and  William were 5 more cats in foster-to-adopt homes from the cafe and were adopted during Maddie's Adoption Days. That brings us to a total of 206 cats adopted out of the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA. You can help us save more cats by donating to our Cat Zone expansion at bit.ly/cattownspc or buying tickets to our Kittens & Cocktails event at bit.ly/kittensandcocktails >^. .^<
