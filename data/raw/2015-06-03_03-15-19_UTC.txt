Introducing Tycoon. He's a 5 year old FIV+ cat who was so scared in the shelter that he was almost labeled as feral. Thanks to Cat Town, he's now settling in to our new space, where he can relax, stretch his legs, and have fun while waiting for a permanent home. If you want to help more cats like Tycoon, consider donating to our Saving Pets Challenge at bit.ly/cattownspc to help make our new space permanent >^. .^<
