This is Fig (and Cat Town founder and Executive Director Ann Dunn) about 10 minutes after we took her from OAS and let her into one of the enclosures in our new space... She was thrilled to be out of the cage and to get a good brushing! If you'd like to see us help more of Oakland's vulnerable cats, you can donate to make our new space permanent at bit.ly/cattownspc and still get tickets to Kittens & Cocktails on 6/19 at bit.ly/kittensandcocktails! The Saving Pets Challenge closes tomorrow at 2PM >^. .^<
