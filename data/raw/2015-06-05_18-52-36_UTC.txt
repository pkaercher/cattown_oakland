We pulled Fig from the shelter after being surrendered to OAS with some strange wounds on her face (hence the cone). She's been recovering in our new space, and just turned into adoption No. 207! You can help us make our new space permanent and support the rescue work we do by donating at bit.ly/cattownspc! The fundraiser is open until 2PM today >^. .^<
