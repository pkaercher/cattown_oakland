Armando is a Russian Blue from the Nine Lives Foundation that we've had in the Cat Zone for quite awhile now. He is getting very sweet and we can't wait to find him a permanent home! E-mail us at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to arrange a time to meet him, or drop by the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA Wed. - Sun. from 10AM - 7PM >^. .^<
