Calvin was adopted from us several months ago, but there wound up being severe allergy issues in the home.Â The family worked really hard to find a remedy, but it was in Calvin's best interest to bring him back so he could find a loving home. You can meet him all week from 10AM - 7PM at 2869 Broadway >^. .^<
