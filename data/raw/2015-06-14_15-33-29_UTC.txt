Charlotte (the Siamese) and Charisse (black) are getting some early morning wrestling in before we open the Cat Zone at 10AM. The 10 and 11 o'clock hours are full, but we've still got space in the rest of the afternoon! Guarantee your visit with the cats by donating at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations or try your luck as a walk-in >^. .^<
