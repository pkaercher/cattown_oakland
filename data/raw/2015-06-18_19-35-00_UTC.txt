Not only did Lloyd open his own cat cafe, but he knows how to sit on his hind legs too! He and his brother Rocky are as sweet as can be and are looking for a permanent home. If you're interested in adopting two playful 1 year old brothers, shoot us an e-mail at cafe@cattownoakland.org or drop by 2869 Broadway to meet them >^. .^<
