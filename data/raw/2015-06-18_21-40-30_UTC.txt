We've got quite a few messages from folks wanting to buy tickets for our "Kittens & Cocktails" event tomorrow, but unfortunately we're sold out! You will however be able to meet [and adopt] the kittens from the event this weekend at the cafe! We'll have kittens in the Cat Zone from 12PM - 5PM on Saturday & Sunday [unless they all get adopted!], make your reservation-donation to guarantee your kitten time at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
