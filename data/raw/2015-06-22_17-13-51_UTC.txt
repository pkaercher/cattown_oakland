The cafe is closed today, but we are urgently looking for a foster for sweet Alexander. 
Alex is a senior male who showed up at OAS a few days ago, was very sick and diagnosed with diabetes. We took him to the vet and he's doing great, he just needs a foster [or adopter!] that is comfortable giving him an insulin shot twice a day.

Is that you!? Are you in Oakland? Can you help sweet Alexander? If you can help, please contact us at info@cattownoakland.org or share his story and help find a home for Alex >^. .^<
