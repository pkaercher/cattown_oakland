Dawson is a 1-2 year old Siamese Flame-point who is making his debut in the Cat Zone today. He is very social and energetic, and will need a home that can help him burn off that energy! He even got a some dog-testing at OAS and would do great with a respectful pup. The 1st Cat Cafe in the USA opens in 15 minutes >^. .^<
