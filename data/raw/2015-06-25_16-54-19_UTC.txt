Kenny is a 10 year old tabby cat who's our 'Foster Cat of the Week!' We're actually looking pretty urgently for a new foster for this sweet and playful old man. He's currently being fostered with another cat, and we think both cats would be much happier to be living solo! If you've never had a senior cat before, Kenny would be a great introduction. While Kenny has moderate kidney disease, it’s been easily managed by a prescription diet. If you can help Kenny out, shoot an e-mail to info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
