These little ladies (+ 4 more kittens!) will be in the Cat Zone Friday, Caturday, and Sunday from 12PM - 5PM! If you're looking for a kitten, this weekend would be a great time to visit, a $10 donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations will guarantee your visit time and help us find homes for Oakland cats and kittens >^. .^<
