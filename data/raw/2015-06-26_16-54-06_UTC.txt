Tilly is a 2 yr old, Female, Brown Tabby who's looking for a home! She went Foster-To-Adopt several weeks ago, but it turns out the other cat in the house didn't really want a roommate. Tilly however was very friendly, and sounds like she'd like to be in a home with another cat. Come meet her today when we open the Cat Zone at 10 >^. .^<
