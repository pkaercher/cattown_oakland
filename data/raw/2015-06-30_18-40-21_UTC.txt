Photo of the week goes to Jenna R. and her shot of Spring [one of the four kittens we had in the Cat Zone this weekend]. Some how her and her brother and sisters didn't get adopted this weekend... but they'll be back from 12PM - 5PM this Sunday [we'll be closed the 4th of July]! Make your reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations or e-mail cafe@cattownoakland.org of you'd like to adopt them sooner >^. .^<
