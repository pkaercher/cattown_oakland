Scooter was part of the gang that came in with Tristan, Rocky, and Lloyd. He didn't spend too much time in the Cat Zone before he left FTA a few weeks ago, sadly it wasn't the right home [he was a little too active and could probably use a home with another playful/friendly cat], so he's back in our care and looking for permanent residence! Come meet him and the 15 other cats in the Cat Zone when we open at 10 AM >^. .^<
