Princess has been a part of our foster program since last fall, so we're giving her a chance to find a home through the cafe. She's a little over a year old, and would likely do best in a home with another playful cat. If you're looking for a companion for your cat at home, this may be your gal! Shoot us an e-mail at cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like more info or set-up a time to meet her >^. .^<
