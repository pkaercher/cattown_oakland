Wow... It was a year ago that we signed the lease for the first cat cafe in the USA! Happy to share that we've added the newly expanded space to the remainder of our lease, and are SO THANKFUL for everyones support in helping us get to here. The cafe (and expansion) have been such a challenge, but we've gotten to save so many more lives and meet so many wonderful people... Thank you! >^. .^<
