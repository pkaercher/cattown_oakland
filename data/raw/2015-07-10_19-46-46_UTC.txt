Iris (and her sisters Summer and Spring, and brother Emerald) are in the Cat Zone today and tomorrow! We're waving the adoption fee for these little ones (who need to be adopted in pairs, or can go singly to a home with another cat) and will be out from 12PM - 7PM. Make a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations and guarantee your play time while supporting our rescue mission >^. .^<
