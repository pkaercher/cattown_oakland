You may remember Rupert and Murdock were adopted a few weeks ago, but turns out the energy of two kittens was a little too much for their adopter and they're back in our care. If you're looking for two playful and energetic fur balls, shoot us an e-mail at cafe@cattownoakland.org or come and see them today and tomorrow from 12PM - 5PM >^. .^<
