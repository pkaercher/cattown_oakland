This could be you today! Come hang out with (and adopt!) the kittens we'll have in the Cat Zone this afternoon, majority of the day is booked, but you can still grab a few spaces and support our cat rescue at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations. Also note that we're closed tomorrow for our volunteer appreciation party >^. .^<
