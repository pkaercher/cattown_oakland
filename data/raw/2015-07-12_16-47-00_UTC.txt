We're closed today for our volunteer appreciation party, but are happy to share that Flora & Fauna are adoptions No. 217 & 218 and are about to head home! Thanks to everyone who visited this week, you can still make a reservation-donation to come next week Wed. - Sun. when we're open from 10AM - 7PM >^. .^<
