The cafe is closed today, but we're so excited to share that Parker left yesterday morning to a foster-to-adopt home! We'll keep you updated on his progress. You can make your reservation-donation to visit our Cat Zone, and have that money applied to your adoption fee if you meet someone you want to take home! www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
