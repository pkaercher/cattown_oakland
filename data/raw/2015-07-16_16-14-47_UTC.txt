Marvin is a 5 y/o male that you'll likely find sitting in the front window of the Cat Zone. Marvin was adopted through our foster program in 2013, but his family had to sell their home 8 months ago and haven't been able to find new permanent space. They were heart broken to do it, but had to make the tough choice of bringing Marvin back to us. He is very confident and out going, and would be a great first cat for someone, is that you? Come meet him this week from 10AM - 7PM at 2869 Broadway >^. .^<
