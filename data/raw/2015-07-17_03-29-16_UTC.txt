The cats aren't all that excited, but we're stoked for the latest item to come in off of our Amazon Wishlist! Huge thanks to Betty S. for our new Cat Zone vacuum cleaner. If you'd also like to donate something to our rescue, check out bit.ly/ctcwishlist, we could really use some new big cat carriers >^. .^<
