Tristan thought this carrier we brought out was for him, here he is ready to go! The carrier was actually for Matisse, who went home foster-to-adopt yesterday, but you can still come meet fiesty and playful Tristan this weekend from 10AM - 7PM, guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
