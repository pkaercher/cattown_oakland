Thanks to everyone who visited the cafe this week! You may have noticed we had a few tags on our building. We were able to get most of two off, but it turns out we have to replace the front window (which will cost about $500), because the tag was done with an etching solution and not paint. These sorta things happen and and we plan on replacing the window, but if you'd like to help us with this unexpected expense you can donate [link in bio] or contact cafe@cattownoakland.org if you happen to own a window replacement shop >^. .^<
P.S. If you're going to tag us, at least tag us with something cat-related!
