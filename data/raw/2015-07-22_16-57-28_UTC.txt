Feebee is out and ready for her first week in the Cat Zone! We've been socializing her, Raina, and two other black cats that all came to the shelter together in our new space, and she let us know she was ready for the main room! You can support our cat rescue by making a tax deductible reservation-donation for the Cat Zone or by giving a one time (or monthly!) donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate >^. .^<
