Here's Conner (the tripod we mentioned in last nights post)! He was found and surrendered to OAS with a shattered leg, which was amputated on July 3rd. He has spent the last couple of weeks recuperating and gaining strength in our new space, and now we're giving him a shot at getting adopted in the Cat Zone. Make your reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations and come meet this sweet boy >^. .^<
