We gave Anise a shot at finding a home in the cafe back in October, but she wasn't very into the other cats. Lucky for us we have an amazing network of foster homes, and while it took some time, we finally found her a home! Fostering can be such an awesome and rewarding experience, so if you live in Oakland and you'd like to get involved, please e-mail info@cattownoakland.org with "Fostering" as the subject and a little info on you and your home >^. .^<
