Just a quick update on Conner (who got adopted this weekend), this photo was taken after about 10 minutes in his new home. "He was so comfortable right away. He figured out how to climb up the stairs to get on the bed so he could sleep with us. He plays and loves belly rubs and has the sweetest little purr and meow. Love him." We are so happy for him! Make a reservation-donation to come meet our 20 adoptable cats when we open the Cat Zone at 10AM today www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
