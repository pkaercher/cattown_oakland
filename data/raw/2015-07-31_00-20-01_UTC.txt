Via our friends at @cinnaholic "Cats and cinnamon rolls are two of our favorite things. So this Saturday, we'll be donating 10% of in-store sales to our feline friends over at Cat Town Cafe. Cat Town is an amazing non profit adoption center located in downtown Oakland. Since opening their doors last October, they've helped more than 200 cats find their furever homes. We love Cat Town Cafe and are so grateful for all the amazing work they do to help kitkats get their happily ever afters. 
So stop by the Cinnaholic Berkeley shop this Saturday, August 1, to treat yourself to a cinnamon roll AND help cats. Can you think of a better way to spend a ... Caturday?" Huge thanks to Nicole and the whole Cinnaholic crew for the tasty treats and wonderful support >^. .^<
