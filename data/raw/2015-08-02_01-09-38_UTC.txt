Meet Skyler, a year old male we've been working with for a few weeks in our newly expanded space. He's very sweet, but startles easy and will likely be in the 'Quiet Zone' during your visit. Make sure to give him some love during your visit! You can even use the code 'CATURDAY' to get half off your resevation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations this weekend >^. .^<
