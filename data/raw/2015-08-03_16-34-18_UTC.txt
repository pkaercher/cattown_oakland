The cafe is closed today, but we'd be so excited to find Raina an adopter or foster-to-adopt home today or tomorrow! She is an awesome 2 year old black cat from OAS who seems to be getting annoyed by the other cats here in the Cat Zone. Shoot us an e-mail to cafe@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to schedule a time to come visit this beautiful lady cat >^. .^<
