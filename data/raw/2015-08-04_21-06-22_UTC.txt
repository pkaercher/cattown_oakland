Remember Vanessa? She spent a couple of months getting socialized with our volunteers here in CZ2, then moved to a foster home in Oakland a few weeks ago. Her fosters are having to move this month, so we're trying to find a new foster home for her this weekend. If you've got time, patience, and experience with socializing shy cats, plus room in your home for this beautiful girl, please e-mail info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
