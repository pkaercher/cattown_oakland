We're at OAS doing some cat-to-cat testing today and pulling 7 new cats that'll be in the cafe next week! Also, mark your calendars for Saturday Aug. 15th for "Clear The Shelter Day!" As you may know, OAS is filled to the brim with kittens, cats, dogs, and more... On the 15th all adoption fees will be waived and the shelter will have extended hours!
