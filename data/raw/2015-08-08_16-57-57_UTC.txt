Looks like our garden has sprouted a bunch of lucky cats for  #InternationalCatDay! What better way to spend a Caturday than to visit the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA?! We've got limited space for walk-ins, or you can guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone by supporting our non-profit cat rescue and making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
