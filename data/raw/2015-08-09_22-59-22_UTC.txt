Homer and Maggie are taking a snooze in the Quiet Zone this afternoon. We're pretty sure he's her dad, and the folks who trapped Homer said that Maggie was sitting on top of the trap waiting patiently and was very cooperative in getting into a carrier. Now we're trying to find them a home together here at the Cat Town Cafe! Come meet them today until 7PM >^. .^<
