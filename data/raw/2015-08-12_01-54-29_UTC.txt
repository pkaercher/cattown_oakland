Can you foster or adopt beautiful 15 year old Opal? She made her way to the shelter after being found outside emaciated and flea infested. Cat Town snagged her, took her to the vet, and got a clean bill of health. She's not a very good candidate for the cafe, but she's safe in CZ2 for now! We'll even be putting her in our "In It For Life" program, where we cover vet bills for the remainder of her days.  If you'd like to learn more about this wonderful old lady, e-mail info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
