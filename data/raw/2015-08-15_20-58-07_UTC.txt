Did you catch Cat Town Founder Ann Dunn on the KPIX Morning News? Ann and Matisse [who is available for adoption at the cafe] were there promoting Oakland Animal Services and #ClearTheShelters day! OAS will be open extended hours [until 6pm], plus all dog, cat, and rabbit adoption fees are waived for today only... Happy Caturday >^. .^<
