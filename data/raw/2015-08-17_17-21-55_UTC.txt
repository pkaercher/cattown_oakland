We have a SUPER URGENT need to get this boy into a new foster or forever home! Reginald (or Reggie, to his pals) thought he had it made in his homeâ€”but it turns out his guardian is allergic. Whaddaya gonna do? But now it turns out we ONLY HAVE A COUPLE DAYS to get this fella situated elsewhere. A super sweet and laid back guy, Reggie will be a delight in your home. And if you are in the Oakland or surrounding areas, you can foster him with the full support of Cat Town, including all supplies. But we're warning you, once you meet him, you might want him forever! Contact info@cattownoakland.org to meet this terrific fella! >^. .^<
