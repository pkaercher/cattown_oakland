Meet Donovan, he came to Cat Town with a terrible leg injury and needed an emergency amputation. The surgery didn't slow him down one bit, and he has stolen the hearts of many volunteers during his recovery in CZ2. Today, on #BlackCatAppreciationDay, we're happy to share that he's gone to a foster-to-adopt home. The bottom photo is him meeting one of his new brothers. 
Many thanks to everyone at the shelter, Claremont Vet, and our awesome staff and volunteers who cared for this guy, and good luck to Dono and his new family. Help us continue our mission of helping Oakland's vulnerable cats by making a tax deductible donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate >^. .^<
