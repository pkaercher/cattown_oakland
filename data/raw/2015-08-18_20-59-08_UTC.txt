Ace (left) and Ben, are 10 year old brothers who were surrendered to OAS in late June. After 3.5 weeks, we were able to bring them into CZ2 to get to know them a bit more. The are still a little shy to new people and the cafe will probably be too overwhelming for them... so we're looking for a foster or adopter for these two wonderful brothers. If you've got a quiet house or apartment and a little bit of patience to get to know these guys, shoot an e-mail to info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
