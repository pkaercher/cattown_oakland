Looking for kittens? 
Then meet Jujube, Backpack, and Jason! Our friend Sabrina [@eatlikealion] found a very pregnant mom-to-be about two months ago, brought her inside, and helped bring her beautiful litter into the world on June 21st. All three have had their first round of vaccines (and will be microchipped/spayed/neutered), and are not shy at all around people, cats, or dogs. They've been weaned from mom, raised on RAWR, and we would love to find a home where they could continue to eat a raw food diet. 
The top two photos are Jujube and Backpack, a bonded brother and sister pair who are very outgoing and adventurous.

Below is Jason, a sweet girl [yes girl] who is the most talkative and independent of the bunch. While she would probably do OK solo, it'd be great to find her a home with another young cat.
