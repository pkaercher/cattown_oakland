Photo of the week comes from IG user @jacquj and this shot of a couple of cats in our window as she walked by on her way to work. It's Wednesday, which means at 10AM the Cat Zone is open for the week! Make a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations to guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone, and support the only non-profit cat cafe in the USA >^. .^<
