Marco, a 3 year old orange tabby with a personality to match his frame, is one of the cats currently available for adoption at the cafe! When he's not settled on a perch to keep a watchful eye on the room's occupants, he can often be found stretched out on one of the green rugs. Stop by 2869 Broadway until 7PM today and meet this handsome boy in person! >^. .^<
