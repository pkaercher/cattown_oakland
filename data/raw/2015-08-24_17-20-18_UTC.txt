Ogden is 3-4 year old orange tabby who can usually be found curled up in our Quiet Zone. Shy but very sweet, he loves to cuddle with other cats and will even push into your hand as you pet him! The cafe is closed today, but we're still open by appointment for potential adopters. If you're interested in making this sweetheart (or any of our other adoptable cats) part of your family, email cafe@cattownoakland.org to schedule a meeting with an adoption counselor! >^. .^<
