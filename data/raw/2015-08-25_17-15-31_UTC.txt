Photo of the week goes to CTC Staff Jay R. for his shot of Delilah helping our HVAC Specialist while he was working in the Cat Zone! We're closed today so we can get new cats acclimated to the space, but you can still visit www.cattowncafe.com/reservations to reserve time with the cats for when we're open Wednesday through Sunday! >^. .^<
