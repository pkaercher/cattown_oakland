We're celebrating Caturday by releasing a new Cat Town / Oaklandish t-shirt and hosting a cat adoption event at the @oaklandishhq Diamond District Store! Come say hello, grab a shirt, and maybe take a cat home tomorrow at 3419 Fruitvale Ave. from 12PM - 4PM. Plus, 10% of that days sales in the store goes to @cattownoakland, we hope to see you there >^. .^<
