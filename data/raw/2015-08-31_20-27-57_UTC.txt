Looks like Clarissa has the right idea... who else wishes they could nap away the rest of Monday!? The cafe is closed today, but if you're interested in meeting any of our adoptable cats shoot us an e-mail to cafe@cattownoakland.org or support our non-profit cat rescue by making a reservation-donation to guarantee your entry to the Cat Zone next week by visiting www.cattowncafe.com/reservations! >^. .^<
