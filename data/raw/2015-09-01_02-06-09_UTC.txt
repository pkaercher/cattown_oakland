Can you foster [or adopt!] Carson? Cat Town pulled him from the shelter about a month ago, and he's been recovering from a minor face injury quietly in Cat Zone 2 for the past couple of weeks. He is a total sweetheart, but has a skin issue [a potential flea or food related allergy] and we're looking to get him into a home where he can relax a little easier. 
He's currently on new flea meds, plus a raw food diet, and Cat Town will supply you with all the necessities [food, litter, bedding, etc.] if you can supply a loving foster home. E-mail info@cattownoakland.org for more info >^. .^<
