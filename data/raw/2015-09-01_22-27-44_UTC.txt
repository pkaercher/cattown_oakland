We got a ton of donations off of our Amazon Wishlist this past week, and put a bunch of new carriers to work yesterday while we moved 7 new cats to the cafe! Huge thanks to Jennifer O., Lisa Von P., Laura S., and Betty S. for their donations. Check out bit.ly/ctcwishlist if you'd like to donate items to our cafe and foster cats >^. .^<
