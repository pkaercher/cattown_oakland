Here's Cat Town Staff Jay R. saying goodbye and good luck to Tina! The lucky gal just left this morning as adoption No. 247 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! We're closed today and tomorrow, but you can still get a head start on planning your week by going to www.cattowncafe.com/reservations to reserve your visit! We're open Wednesday through Sunday. >^. .^<
