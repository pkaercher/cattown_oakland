Congrats to these two former @hoodcats, Rupert & Murdoch! They've been in a foster-to-adopt home the past few weeks and have just officially become adoptions No. 248 & 249 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! Come make a new feline friend (or two!) tomorrow from 10AM to 7PM, and support our non-profit cat rescue by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations >^. .^<
