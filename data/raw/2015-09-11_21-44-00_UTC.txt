If you've visited the cafe recently, you may remember meeting Matisse, a spry 12 year old with a heart of gold. Yesterday ended up being his lucky day, and we're so happy to say he is now adoption No. 252 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! You can help other cats like Matisse by making a reservation-donation before your visit at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations, or by making a donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate! >^. .^<
