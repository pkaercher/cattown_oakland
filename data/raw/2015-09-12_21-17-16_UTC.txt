Meet Joey! She's a one year old, former mother of five who has been in our foster program since giving birth. After getting the babies weaned off of her and adopted, it's now finally her turn to find a forever home! She is spayed, microchipped, and vaccinated, and will be heading to the cafe next week unless we can find her special someone sooner! She loves the outdoors and exploring, but enjoys hanging out on the sofa with her people too. Joey also loves her raw food diet, which we would like to keep her on, and is being sponsored by Purrific Petsitting and RAWR. That means her adoption fee is waived and she comes with a week of RAWR food to get her started, plus a lifetime 10% off on RAWR as well! If you're interested in meeting this sweet girl, e-mail sabrina@eatlikealion.com or come see her next Wednesday at the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! >^. .^<
