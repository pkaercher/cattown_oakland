We knew a cat who loves to give hugs and take selfies wouldn't last long in the Cat Zone! Very happy trails to sweet Sloane, adoption No. 253 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! We're closed for the night, but come join us tomorrow from 10AM to 7PM at 2869 Broadway and make some new feline friends. >^. .^<
