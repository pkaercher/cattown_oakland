Meet Marmalade and Maybelline! When Marmalade (right) first arrived at the shelter, she wouldn’t let anyone interact with her. Hoping to build her confidence, Cat Town soon took her in, but her progress was slow until Maybelline came along. Pregnant and initially very wary of people, Maybelline spent most of her time in a crate at the shelter before coming to Cat Town. There she was introduced to Marmalade, and the two immediately hit it off! Maybelline became a role model for her new friend, and as her comfort zone grew, so did Marmalade’s. Now Maybelline is a playful and affectionate girl (who often greets her human visitors with cute little chirps!), and by following her inspiring example, Marmalade has also been able to make monumental strides! After spending months working with Cat Town’s dedicated staff and volunteers, these sweethearts are now finally ready to find their forever home together. If you can offer a quiet and patient place for these girls to continue to blossom in, email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting! >^. .^<
