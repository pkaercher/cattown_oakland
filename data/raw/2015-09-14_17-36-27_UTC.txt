Proton is a sweet, 5 month old brown tabby who LOVES to play! The cafe is closed today and tomorrow, but you can come see this little guy and his sister, Electron (the grey kitten in the previous post), when we open back up on Wednesday! Go to www.cattowncafe.com/reservations to schedule your visit in advance and support our non-profit cat rescue. >^. .^<
