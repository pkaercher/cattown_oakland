Here's the latest batch of cats that'll be available for adoption at the Cat Town Cafe on Wednesday! 
Did you know that Cat Town is a 501c3 non-profit cat rescue? While the cafe acts as a permanent fundraiser for us, we couldn't help cats like Hughes, Graham, Cameron & Clark, Chuck & Taylor, and Otto without your support! If you love the work we do, consider becoming a monthly donor and help us help more cats at www.cattownoakland.org/donate >^. .^<
