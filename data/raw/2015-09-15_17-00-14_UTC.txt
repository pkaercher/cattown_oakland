We don't normally announce when cats go into Foster-to-Adopt arrangements, but Jamaica is a special girl! She's a former @hoodcats cat that came to us in May last year as she was giving birth to a litter of kittens in the back of an animal control officer's truck... The remaining kittens were born in Cat Town Founder and Executive Director Ann Dunn's bathroom!

It took a LONG time for Jamaica to get comfortable in her foster home, but with patience and care she eventually did, and after a couple of months here in the cafe she has hopefully found her permanent home (fingers-crossed)! We couldn't help cats like Jamaica without the support of our amazing community. You can help make a difference in these cats' lives by donating to our rescue at www.cattownoakland.org/donate or by making one in person here at the cafe! >^. .^<
