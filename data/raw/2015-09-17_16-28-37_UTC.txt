Sometimes it's a struggle to wake up in the morning! Cameron (left) and Chuck are getting some last minute snuggling in before the first group of visitors arrive at 10AM. Stop by 2869 Broadway to meet these sweet boys and the rest of our 18 adoptable cats, and guarantee your entry by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations! We're open until 7PM. >^. .^<
