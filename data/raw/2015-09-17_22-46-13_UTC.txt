Donovan recently went to a home as a Foster-to-Adopt, but even with three legs, he had so much energy that he was overwhelming the other cats in the house. Now he's back in the cafe to look for his forever home and the little guy hasn't slowed down one bit! We're open until 7PM tonight, so come meet this spirited 5 month old at 2869 Broadway! >^. .^<
