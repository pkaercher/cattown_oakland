In addition to Malcolm finding his home this weekend, Chuck & Taylor, Cameron & Clark, Proton & Electron, Donovan, and Marco (who has been foster-to-adopt the past couple of weeks) have all found permanent homes! That makes 262 adoptions from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA. If you appreciate all the help we provide for Oakland cats, consider supporting our rescue efforts by making a tax-deductible donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate >^. .^<
