Congratulations to beautiful Helga, who was only here for a day and a half before being scooped up as adoption No. 265 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! We still have lots of cats hoping to find homes, so come by and meet them until 7PM tonight or plan your visit for another day by going to www.cattowncafe.com/reservations! >^. .^<
