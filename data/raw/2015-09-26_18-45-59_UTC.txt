We're so excited for River! We were working with him in our adoption center for a few weeks when the adopters of Calvin, a previous cafe cat, came in looking for someone that could be a buddy for him. River had mostly been hiding under a blanket, but he came out to win Melissa & Greg over... Now he's adoption No. 266 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! >^. .^<
