Sweet little Lila had been at the shelter for just over two months before we brought her to the cafe this week... we're happy to share that she had the best Caturday ever, and Lila just became adoption No. 267 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! 
Come help us close out our week tomorrow from 10AM - 7PM and support our non-profit cat rescue by making an appointment for the Cat Zone at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com >^. .^<
