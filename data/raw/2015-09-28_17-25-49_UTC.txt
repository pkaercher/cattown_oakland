When Trevor (left) began his time with Cat Town, he had never had much human contact before. He would hide in a covered litter box and never come out (even eating within it!) and wouldn’t let anyone near him. However, the day an orange tabby named Oliver showed up, that began to change! Having lived underneath a house for years where his only experience with people came from receiving food, Oliver himself wasn’t very social, but the moment he arrived at Cat Town he marched over to Trevor’s hiding place and climbed right in beside him! The two have been best buddies ever since, often cuddling together in their favorite wicker chair.

Without the friendship Oliver’s provided, it’s quite likely that Trevor would still be hiding away in his litter box. While still working on expanding his comfort levels, Trevor now accepts pets and even recently brought one of our volunteers to tears when he purred for the first time and pushed back into her hand! Meanwhile, although he doesn’t have high confidence yet, Oliver loves to play with feather toys and enjoys gentle full body pets, showing the potential to become a loving companion to his future guardian.

We believe it is in the best interests of both cats that they stay together so they can continue to build their confidence and personalities in a safe, quiet home with a guardian who is open to whomever they become! If you think you could be the person they need, please email info@cattownoakland.org to set up an introduction! =^･.･^=
