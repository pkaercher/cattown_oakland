These scratchers are always a huge hit in the Cat Zone, but with so many cats, we go through them pretty quickly! You can help keep our non-profit adoption center a cozy place by sending our cats toys, food, litter, scratchers and other necessities from our Amazon Wishlist at bit.ly/ctcwishlist, or by making a tax deductible donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate! >^. .^<
