Adoption No. 270 goes to Truffle who came to us from @feralchange, and went to her foster-to-adopt home back in May. 
Here's what her mom has to say about her, "My housemates and I all love her dearly; she sits on our laps while we watch TV, and keeps us company while we work during the day. I renamed her Sappho, after the ancient Greek poet. The greek poet Sappho wrote a lot of love poems, which fits her perfectly; she is a total love and is constantly talking to us." >^. .^<
