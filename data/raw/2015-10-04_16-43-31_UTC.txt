Boise is a gorgeous 2 year old who can most often be found in our Quiet Zone. While still on the shy side, he becomes quite affectionate once you win him over! Come meet this sweetheart today from 10AM to 7PM at 2869 Broadway, and guarantee your time with our 16 adoptable cats by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations! =^･.･^=
