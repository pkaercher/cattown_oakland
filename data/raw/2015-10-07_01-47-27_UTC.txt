Holy cats... It's been nearly a year since we opened the Cat Town Cafe. In that time, Cat Town found homes for more than 400 cats between our Cafe and Foster Program! While helping that many cats is amazing, it also means our vet bills have gone up considerably! So, we're excited to announce our new Patreon campaign. With this campaign, we're asking our supporters to pledge a small dollar amount every time we find a cat a new home.
