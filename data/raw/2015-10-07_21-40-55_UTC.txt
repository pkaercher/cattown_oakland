Dottie & Kit came to us from OAS last Monday [top photo], met a wonderful family on Sunday, and are now adoption No. 273 and 274 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! 
If you love seeing these updates and want to support our rescue efforts, then check out our new Patreon campaign. We're trying to get 100 people to pledge $1 every time we send a cat to a new home by the end of the month!
