Meet Felix (left) and Ozzie, two 10 month old brothers who can often be found curled up in our Quiet Zone! We're closing a little early tonight for our Cat Zone Yoga session, but you can still come hang out with these handsome fellas (and our 18 other adoptable cats) this evening until 6PM at 2869 Broadway! =^･.･^=
