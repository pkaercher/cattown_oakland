Here's Freddy, the sweetest FeLV+ Orange Tabby you'll ever meet! He's also the latest cat to find a home through our foster program, and the most recent post on our Patreon Campaign! 
There are so few rescue groups that would give a guy like Freddy a chance due to his health problems, so check out www.patreon.com/cattown [link in bio] and make a pledge to help fund Cat Town every time we find a cat a new home >^. .^<
