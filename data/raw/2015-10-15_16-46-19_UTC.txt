Sweet Chaplin was only with us for 3 short days before he worked his magic and became adoption No. 279 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! Make a pledge that helps us help more cats like Chaplin at www.patreon.com/cattown, and come meet our 21 other adoptable cats today when the Cat Zone opens at 10AM! =^･.･^=
