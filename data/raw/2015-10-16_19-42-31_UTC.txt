Happy #FeralCatDay! This is Bijou, her and her sister Esme were found by our friends at Fix Our Ferals [who provide low cost spay/neuter services here in the East Bay for community cats]. They were part of a pretty crazy hoarding situation, but wound up being the sweetest cats! Come meet them this weekend from 10AM - 7PM at 2869 Broadway >^. .^<
