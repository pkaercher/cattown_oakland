Happy Birthday to Tom, a crazy cat man, who celebrated his 91st birthday with us in the Cat Zone. Next week is our own one year anniversary, so come celebrate the nearly 300 adoptions we've had and help support the only non-profit Cat Cafe in the USA by making a reservation [only $5 for the rest of the month!] at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com >^. .^<
