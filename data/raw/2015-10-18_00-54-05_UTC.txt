Fan favorite Marvin has been in the Cat Zone since July, and now we're so excited to share that he became adoption No. 281 last night! We're all going to miss him, but we know he's going to be so happy in his new home. You can read more about Marvin's adoption and help us find more cats the homes they deserve by pledging to Cat Town at www.patreon.com/cattown! =^･.･^=
