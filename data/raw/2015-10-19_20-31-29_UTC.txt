We're closed today, but are pretty excited to announce our first two Cat Zone Movie Nights! On Tuesday the 27th we'll be showing Hocus Pocus, and on Thursday the 29th we'll be showing Stephen King's Cat's Eye! Entrance gets you all the popcorn you can eat, a drink from the cafe, plus you're supporting the only non-profit cat cafe in the USA! Space is limited, so book now at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com >^. .^<
