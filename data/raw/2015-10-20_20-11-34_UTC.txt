Got a new Oakland inspired victorian in the Cat Zone for our year anniversary! Come check it out, along with our 21 adoptable cats when we open the Cat Zone tomorrow at 10AM. 
As part of our celebration, we've made the reservation-donation $5, so go guarantee your entry and support the only non-profit cat cafe in the USA at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com! >^. .^<
