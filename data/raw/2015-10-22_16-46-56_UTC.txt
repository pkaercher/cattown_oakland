Holly is a beautiful, playful girl who loves a good conversation with her human(s). We're closing a little early today for our evening session of Cat Zone Yoga, but you can still come meet Holly and the rest of our 20 adoptable cats from 10AM to 6PM! Guarantee your entry for only $5 by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com. =^･.･^=
