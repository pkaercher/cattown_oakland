Cheers to Mirabel, adoption No. 283 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! This sweet little lady was in our foster program for a little over a month to get treated for ringworm before coming to the Cat Zone, where she only lasted about a week! Help support the only non-profit Cat Cafe in the USA, by pledging as little as a dollar every time we find a cat a new home at www.patreon.com/cattown >^. .^<
