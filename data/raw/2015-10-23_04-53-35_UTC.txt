Daphne left the Cat Zone back in May for her foster-to-adopt home... They wanted to make sure that her and her new dog brother were going to get along. Luckily they did, and now she's adoption No. 284 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA!

Come celebrate our year anniversary with us this Sunday! Adoption fee's will be waived Saturday and Sunday, plus we'll have a photo wall, cat themed arts and crafts, and the @hellaveganeats truck will be parked in front of the cafe starting at noon. Guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone with a $5 reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com >^. .^<
