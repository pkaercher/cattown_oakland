Great scott! We may be a little late for #backtothefutureday, but it's never too late to share a foster-to-adopt cat getting adopted! Herbert (now Marty Mcfly) makes adoption No. 285 for the Cat Town Cafe. Come celebrate our one-year anniversary with us this weekend with all adoption fees waived and reservations only costing $5! Snag your spot now at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com because it's going to be a busy weekend >^. .^<
