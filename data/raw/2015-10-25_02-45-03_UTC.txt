Adoption No. 288 is on his way home! Sweet and playful Avocado was only with us for a few days, but is bound to give his new mom a lifetime of memories. Come meet your new furry friend and help us celebrate a year of coffee and cats tomorrow at 10AM! Still have some spots available in the afternoon while @hellaveganeats dishes out delicious food from 12PM - 4PM, so guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com >^. .^<
