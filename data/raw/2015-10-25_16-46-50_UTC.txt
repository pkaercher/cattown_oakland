It's our one year cativersary! To help us celebrate, we've got yummy food from the @hellaveganeats truck from 12PM to 4PM, plus arts and crafts and a photo wall all day long! Come grab a coffee and join the party with our 16 adoptable cats from 10AM to 7PM, and make a $5 reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com to guarantee your spot in all the fun! =^･.･^=
