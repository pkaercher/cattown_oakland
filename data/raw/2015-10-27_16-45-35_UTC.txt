We'll be catching up on adoption announcements today, but first, we want to take a second and thank all of our amazing volunteers who help make Cat Town what it is! Between the Cafe and our Foster Program, we have found HUNDREDS of people who are so passionate and excited about finding cats homes, and we couldn't do the work we do without them. Thank you so much for everything you give to these cats and for helping us make this year our most successful! - Ann Dunn and Adam Myatt
