The cats sure did get a lot of treats yesterday from our Amazon Wishlist! Monroe wants to thank everyone for the gifts; she's having fun already. Interested in donating something to our cafe and foster program? You can view our most needed items at bit.ly/ctcwishlist and donate them with only a few clicks of the mouse! =^･.･^=
