Congrats to Garth, adoption No. 296! This little ginger was part of our 'Forgotten Kitten Project' and had a spat of ringworm that he'd been recovering from the last couple weeks before getting cleared. We're happy that he's headed home with his new dad! Learn more and help us help more cats, by donating to Cat Town every time we find a cat a home at www.patreon.com/cattown >^. .^<
