Meet Campbell [the tabby] and Linden [B&W], two RIDICULOUSLY cute Hoodkittens available for adoption here at the Cat Town Cafe! They were trapped by Mr.@hoodcats himself a little over a week ago, and are such great little kittens! They're available by appointment only, so shoot us an e-mail at info@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to schedule a time to visit, we'd love to find them a new home [or even foster!] this weekend >^. .^<
