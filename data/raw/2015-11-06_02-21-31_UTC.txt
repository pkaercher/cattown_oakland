Scooter (orange tabby, now Charlie Day) left the cafe a little while ago as a foster-to-adopt with Quinn W., one of our volunteers, and we're so pleased to share that he's officially adoption no. 300!

Here's what Quinn and her husband, Chad, have to say: "We were looking for a confident cat to be BFFs with our shy little Phoenix, and boy did we find him! Charlie immediately wanted to be friends with Phee, and it didn't take long for them to start snuggling pretty hard. There was definitely some back and forth early on, but Cat Town was always there with advice and support. We even talked with one of Cat Town's behavior specialists to make sure their introduction was going okay. We knew that we would be able to make it work because Cat Town was there to help." Congratulations to the happy family! You can help our non-profit cat rescue help more cats like Scooter by pledging to donate as little as $1 every time Cat Town finds a cat a new home at www.patreon.com/cattown. =^･.･^=
