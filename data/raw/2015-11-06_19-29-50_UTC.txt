Benson wants to remind everyone that today is the 1st Friday of the month, which means it's #FreeCoffeeFriday here at the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! Special note that we've got the folks from Shelter Me filming at the cafe this weekend, so guarantee your entry for a chance to be on the show and make a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com >^. .^<
