Congrats to Violet, who came to us from @berkeleyanimals last week, for becoming adoption No. 301. Come visit us this weekend while Shelter Me is filming in the Cat Zone! Make a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com with the code "SHELTERME" to get half off of reservations this Caturday and Sunday >^. .^<
