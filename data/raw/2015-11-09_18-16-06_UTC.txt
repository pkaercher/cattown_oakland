Archer was so excited to go home and ran right into his new carrier as soon as we opened the door! Congrats to him [adoption No. 307] and his new mom Sarah. We're closed today and tomorrow, but you can always check out our cats available for adoption in the cafe and foster program at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
