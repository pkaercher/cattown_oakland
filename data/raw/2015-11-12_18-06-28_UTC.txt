Wake up, Coral, the Cat Zone is opening! We're closing a little earlier tonight for Cat Zone Yoga, but you can still come grab a coffee or pastry and meet our 18 adoptable cats today until 6PM! You can ensure your entry to the Cat Zone (and support our non-profit rescue while doing so) by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.com/reservations. =^･.･^=
