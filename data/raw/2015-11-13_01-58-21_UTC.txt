Toffee was one of the cats we pulled from @berkeleyanimals about two weeks ago. We were treating her in CZ2 for an eye infection, and getting her ready to move into the main Cat Zone... Evidently the Cat Zone wasn't in the cards for this lady, because she just became adoption No. 309! Help Cat Town find more homes for cats like Toffee, and pledge as little as a dollar every time we find a cat a home at www.patreon.com/cattown [link in bio] >^. .^<
