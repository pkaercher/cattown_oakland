Bye bye Birdie! This amazing little lady has had quite a life... Coming from a hoarding situation in Oakland with a broken leg that had to be amputated, to our friends at Fix Our Ferals, then to us here in the Cat Zone. Now we're happy to share she's celebrating Caturday by going home as adoption No. 310! Help Cat Town find more homes for cats, by pledging a dollar every time we find a cat a home at www.patreon.com/cattown >^. .^<
