Buttercup was at OAS for over 4 months, now she's the mayor of Kitty Hall! She loves to play with the bird-wand toy, but is a little overwhelmed by the other cats in the space. We're hoping to find her a home this weekend where she can be the queen of the castle... So come meet her this weekend from 10AM to 7PM at 2869 Broadway >^. .^<
