Congratulations to Dahlia, adoption No. 312! A lap cat to the extreme, we knew it wouldn't take her long to work her magic.

Interested in bringing home a new family member? Learn about all of the adoptable cats in our foster program at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt, and come meet our cafe cats Wednesday through Sunday at 2869 Broadway! =^･.･^=
