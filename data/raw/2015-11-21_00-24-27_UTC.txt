Remember Liam from yesterday? He was covered in flea dirt and his eye was sealed shut with goop... but it's amazing what 24 hours will do! Now he's eating, purring, making biscuits, and headed to a new foster home in a few minutes! We couldn't help all the cats we do without your support, so consider making a donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate and fund our non-profit cat rescue >^. .^<
