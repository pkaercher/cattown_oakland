Meet Crawford! While she used to spend most of her time in our Quiet Zone, recently Crawford has begun venturing out into the main Cat Zone to socialize with visitors and hang out with her BFF, Monroe (you may recognize her from previous posts!). The two of them would love to find their forever home together soon, so come get to know them both today from 10AM to 7PM! Try your luck as a walk in, or beat the weekend crowd by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com to guarantee your entry. =^･.･^=
