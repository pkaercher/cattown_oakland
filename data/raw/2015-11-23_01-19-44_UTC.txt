Said adios to Lexi, adoption No. 313 today! If you enjoy seeing all these adoption updates, then consider supporting Cat Town at www.patreon.com/cattown [link in bio] where you can pledge as little as a dollar every time we find a cat a home, you can even set a monthly limit so you never go over your budget! The cats [and the humans!] of Cat Town really appreciate the support >^. .^<
