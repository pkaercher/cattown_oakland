Monroe & Crawford's new mom and dad were SO excited to be bringing them home today! That's adoption No. 314 & 315 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA! We're closed through Thursday for the holiday, so make sure and book your appointment in the Cat Zone this weekend (it's going to be busy!) at www.cattowncafe.com >^. .^<
