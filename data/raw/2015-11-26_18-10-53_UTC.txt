We're closed today, and the cats are done with their Thanksgiving Breakfast Feast! Join us today as we stream the Cat Zone live from 10AM - 12PM at bit.ly/maddiescam! We'd like to give a special thanks to all of our staff and volunteers who help make Cat Town all that it is... We couldn't do this without them! We'll see you tomorrow www.cattowncafe.appointy.com >^. .^<
