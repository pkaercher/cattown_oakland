If you were in the Cat Zone in the last week or so, you may have gotten a chance to play with little Hugo the 4 month old brown tabby... Now he's headed home from the 1st Cat Cafe in the US as adoption No. 318! We're open for a few more hours today and have plenty of adoptable cats, so swing by 2869 Broadway or check out the cats available in the cafe and our foster program at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
