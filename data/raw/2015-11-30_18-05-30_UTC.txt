We're closed today and tomorrow while we help new cats acclimate to the Cat Zone, but we've got quite a few adoption announcements... First up is Carter, who was only in the Cat Zone for a few days before being scooped up by a loving family and becoming adoption No. 319! Check out all of our adoptable cats in our cafe and foster program at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
