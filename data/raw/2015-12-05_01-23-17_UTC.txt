Quinn is another awesome cat who found her new home today, which makes adoption No. 323! She's a lucky gal, and was only in the shelter for a few weeks, before coming to spend a few days with us in the Cat Zone, and now is with an awesome family! We love helping all of these incredible cats, and couldn't do it without your support! So, swing by the cafe this weekend and snag some great gifts for that cat-loving friend in your life, or consider making a donation at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
