Jedi met this fine couple yesterday, and took about a two hour nap in their lap... So they just had to come back today and take the little dude home! That makes adoption 324 from the Cat Town Cafe! 
Make sure to come check out the book release, art party, and @hellaveganeats brunch tomorrow from 12PM - 4PM >^. .^<
