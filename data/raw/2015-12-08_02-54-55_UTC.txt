Buttercup also found her family this weekend! That makes adoption No. 326 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA, and if you like seeing all these adoption updates, consider supporting us via our campaign at www.patreon.com/cattown [link in bio] and support us with as little as a dollar every time we find a cat a home >^. .^<
