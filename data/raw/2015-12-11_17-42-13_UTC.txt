Savannah is celebrating Friday by having some street tacos for breakfast! We're opening a little late today for some more filming, but you can still hang out with our 18 adoptable cats from 12PM to 7PM! Come as a walk-in, or visit www.cattowncafe.appointy.com to make a reservation-donation that guarantees your entry. =^･.･^=
