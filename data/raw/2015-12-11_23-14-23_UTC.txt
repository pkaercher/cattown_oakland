The weekend is almost upon us, so grab a friend and congratulate yourselves on making it through the week with cat-themed treats, coffee, and (best of all) the company of 18 adoptable cats at 2869 Broadway! Can't make it out today? We still have room tomorrow and Sunday, so head over to www.cattowncafe.appointy.com to secure your spot and bypass the weekend crowd. =^･.･^=
