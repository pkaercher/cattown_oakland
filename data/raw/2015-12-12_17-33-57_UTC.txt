It's Caturday and Liam can't wait to see what the day has in store... With a little luck, maybe he'll even find his forever home! We open at 10AM, so come meet this sweetheart in the Cat Zone at 2869 Broadway, and support our non-profit cat rescue by making a reservation-donation for your visit at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com! =^･.･^=
