Best wishes to Jonah, who just left as adoption No. 327 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA!

Like seeing when cats find homes? Then consider supporting our campaign at www.patreon.com/cattown [link in bio]. There you can donate as little as $1 every time a cat gets adopted, helping us rescue more cats and allowing us to continue the cycle of finding them forever families! =^･.･^=
