Congratulations to Pansy, who also left for her new home, bringing the adoption count to 328! We're closed for the evening, but you can still meet the rest of our 15 adoptable cats tomorrow from 10AM to 7PM. Visit www.cattowncafe.appointy.com to make a reservation-donation and guarantee your entry! =^･.･^=
