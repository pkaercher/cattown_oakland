We also said goodbye and good luck to Liam last night! He's now adoption No. 329 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA!

We couldn't find these cats homes without all the support from you guys. If you're looking for a way to help out this holiday season, please consider pledging to our campaign at www.patreon.com/cattown [link in bio], where you can sign up to donate as little as $1 each time a cat gets adopted! =^･.･^=
