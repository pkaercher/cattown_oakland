Our friends at Worldwise Inc. are filming in the Cat Zone again this morning to get some shots of the cats playing with their line of toys, but we'll be opening back up to the public at noon! Come down, grab a drink or snack, and make some new feline friends from then until 7PM. As always, you can reserve your spot in advance at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com. =^･.･^=
