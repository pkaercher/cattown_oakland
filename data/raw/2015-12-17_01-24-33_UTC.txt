Princess (adoption No. 330!) has been with Cat Town for a long time, being one of the more under socialized cats we've worked with, she spent several months in our foster program and was one of our longer term cafe cats... But we just got this great update from her adopters! "Princess (or P-Butt as we've taken to calling her) will play and allow light petting, but only on her terms. She's still wary, but slowly letting us in. We love her to pieces and can't wait to earn her love!" We can't express how great it is to find adopters like this, who are willing to give cats the patience and time they need to open up!
