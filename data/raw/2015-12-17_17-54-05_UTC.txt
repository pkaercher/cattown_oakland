Annika is helping us set up the Cat Zone so everything's ready when we open at 10AM! Confident and gentle, this 5 year old lady would love nothing more than to be your new best friend. Come meet her (and our 22 other adoptable cats) today until 6PM at 2869 Broadway! You can guarantee your entry by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com. =^･.･^=
