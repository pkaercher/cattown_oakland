Cat Town has a donor that is looking to make a $10,000 donation to us, if we can match it! We could DEFINITELY use this money to help more cats like mustachioed Ben, who is waiting for us to pull him for our foster program. 
You can help us hit our goal by making a donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate and e-mail info@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in fostering. Please share and donate if you can >^. .^<
