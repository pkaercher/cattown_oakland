The Cat Zone is getting a late opening (12PM) today due to some more filming with our friends from Worldwise, but you can spend breakfast with Olivia and Lucy in the quiet zone on our webcam #ThanksToMaddies! Head over to bit.ly/maddiescam to check it out, and make your reservation-donation at www.cattownoakland.org to hang out the rest of this weekend >^. .^<
