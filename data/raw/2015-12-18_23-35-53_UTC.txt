Can you foster Dillon?! We met this 13 year old Persian guy today and couldn't leave the shelter without him... He came in with extremely matted fur (which is very painful) and is heading to the vet to get a lion's cut and an exam... What we don't have is a safe place for him to land, do you have room for him in your home? Send us an e-mail to info@cattownoakland.org with a little info about your home set-up if you can help (please note we can only take new fosters from Oakland at this time) >^. .^<
