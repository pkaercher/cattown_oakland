We open in just a few minutes at 10AM and sweet Annika can't wait to make some new friends! Start your winter break off right by meeting her and our 16 other adoptable cats in the Cat Zone today until 7PM. Stay one step ahead of the weekend crowd (and support the only non-profit cat cafe in the USA while doing so!) by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com, and we'll see you at 2869 Broadway! =^･.･^=
