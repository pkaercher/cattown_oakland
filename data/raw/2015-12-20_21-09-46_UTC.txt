Congratulations to Tofu! He gobbled up his final breakfast with us and went on his merry way as adoption No. 332 from the 1st (and only non-profit) Cat Cafe in the USA!

Enjoy seeing the work we do? Cat Town has a donor looking to give us $10,000 IF we can match it! Help us reach our goal by making a tax-deductible donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate [link in bio]- every bit helps! =^･.･^=
