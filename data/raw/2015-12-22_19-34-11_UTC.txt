Please help us raise at least $10,000 by December 31, to be eligible for a generous matching donation!  You know weâ€™ll continue to go out on a limb for the cats who have no other hope for getting out of the Oakland shelter, like 6-year-old Seymour.  After his caretaker could no longer care for him, he responded to being in a cage by being pretty swatty and unpredictable. Thankfully one of our amazing fosters gave him a chance.  Here they are shortly after his arrival. He's a sweetheart! Please go to to http://www.cattownoakland.org/donate/ to fill 2016 with many more happy endings.
