Billy here showed up at the Oakland shelter (top left) with a unique condition where his eyelashes were constantly rubbing and scratching his eyeballs (imagine how uncomfortable and painful that would be!), which required surgery to correct. Were it not for that, this sweetheart would have sailed to adoption, but instead he waited two months before we had the resources for the surgery.  Now, after a little recovery time (top right), he's waiting to meet you at the Cat Town Cafe, and ready for his permanent home.

If you can, help us match a new $10,000 donation before Dec. 31st at www.cattownoakland.org/donate which will make sure we can quickly get the cats out of the shelter who need it most >^. .^<
