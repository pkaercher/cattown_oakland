Thanks to your generous support, we matched the $10k donation!! So you know where the money goes, let's check in on Gus, last mentioned when we urgently needed to get him out of the shelter (top left). He was a wreck – congested, with a skin condition, covered in flea dirt and seriously affection-starved. Fast forward a few weeks (past his bath and a couple trips to the vet) and see him in his foster home, where he’s thriving and inches away from being adopted. You can file this one under ‘why we do what we do’! We could still use your continued support, so stop by www.cattownoakland.org/donate to see all the ways you can help... And Meowwy Catmas from all of us here at Cat Town >^. .^<
