Twas the night before Catmas, and all through Cat Town... Was a big celebration, as PJ and Luna head out! These two awesome cats got a new home for Christmas and make adoption No. 338 and 339 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA. Thanks to everyone who came by today, we're closed tomorrow and hope you have a wonderful holiday with your friends and family >^. .^<
