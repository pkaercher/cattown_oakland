Pirate came to us back at the end of October and wound up having ringworm, which was unfortunate for him because he had to be isolated and given a fungal wash everyday. It didn't stop him from charming his way into a new home though, and now he's headed there as adoption No. 342! Lots of rescues would have shyed away from a cat with ringworm (because it is pretty contagious) but we were willing to treat him and now he has a family! 
If you enjoy seeing the work Cat Town does then consider helping us stay afloat and help more cats like Pirate at www.cattownoakland.org/donate >^. .^<
