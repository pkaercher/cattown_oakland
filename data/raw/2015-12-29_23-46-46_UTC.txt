Nine-year-old Mickey was so nervous at the Oakland shelter that he just hid under his blanket, so itâ€™d be pretty easy to pass him by. Since our reason for being is to take a chance on cats who are too scared at the shelter, that got him to the top of our list to help. He went to a foster home on Saturday and walked right out of his carrier with his tail up high, ready for love. To see every shelter cat get the chance he deserves, please support our work at www.cattownoakland.org/donate >^. .^<
