Buttercup's getting in a few more winks until the day's first batch of guests arrive at 10AM! With a playful and energetic spirit, nothing would excite this girl more than some quality playtime with you and a feather toy. Come meet her and our 19 other adoptable cats today until 6PM! You can support our non-profit cat rescue and guarantee your Cat Zone entry simultaneously with a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com! =^･.･^=
