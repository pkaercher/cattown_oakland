This is Charlotte, she's a 1 year old tortie who has had quite a life! She was brought to the shelter about a month ago, was pregnant and had a damaged eye (which had to be removed). Now she's in the Cat Zone looking for a new home! We'd like to find her a quiet place to live while she continues to adjust to life post-surgery, and if that sounds like you, e-mail info@cattownoakland.org! Can't adopt but want to support our non-profit rescue? The make a tax-deductible donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate >^. .^<
