The cats are getting ready for opening at 10AM! Come complete your weekend with a trip to the Cat Zone- you can stay one step ahead of Sunday crowds by securing your spot with a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.org! We've got cats, coffee, and cafe treats until 7PM here at 2869 Broadway. =^･.･^=
