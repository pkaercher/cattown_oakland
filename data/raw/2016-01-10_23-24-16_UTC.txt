Darcy, pictured here in the penthouse suite of the Tribune Tower, is a 10 month old "torbie" who came to us from @oaklandanimalservices. A little shy to start, once she warms up there's no stopping her purrs! Come meet this affectionate lady in the Cat Zone and see for yourself until 7PM this evening! =^･.･^=
