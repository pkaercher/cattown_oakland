We had a busy weekend! Sweet little Darcy was brought to the shelter by our friends at @feralchange before making her way to the Cat Zone, and just left us as adoption No. 350! Thanks to everyone who stopped by this week; we'll be closed tomorrow and Tuesday to acclimate new cats into the space before we open back up on Wednesday. Support our cat rescue and guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone next week at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
