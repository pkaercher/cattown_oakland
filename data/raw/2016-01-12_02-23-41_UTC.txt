Here's 7 of the 8 new guys and gals we pulled from the shelter today who'll be in the Cat Zone on Wednesday! If you love seeing all the cats we're helping, you can support our non-profit cat rescue by making a tax-deductible donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate or visiting the cafe Wed. - Sun. from 10AM - 7PM >^. .^<
