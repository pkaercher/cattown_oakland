The gang's all here! We're opening for the week in just a few minutes at 10AM, and we've got 18 adoptable cats who would love to meet you! Guarantee your time in the Cat Zone (and support our non-profit cat rescue!) by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.org, and come play with some of the coolest cats in town. We're open until 7PM! =^･.･^=
