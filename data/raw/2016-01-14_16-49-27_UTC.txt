Little Buttercup is wide awake and already watching the windows for action! At 9 months old, her energetic spirit makes her a bit of a firecracker, but she's also known for her affectionate side. Come play with her today from 10AM to 6PM- Who knows, you might be her lap of choice when it's time for a nap! Try your luck as a walk-in or reserve your spot in the Cat Zone through a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.org, and we'll see you soon at 2869 Broadway! =^･.･^=
