Our favorite baker (@rollingsloanes) is back from vacation, which means we've got pop-tarts (vegan and regular), cat sugar cookies, and vegan brownies! Snag a tasty treat and a coffee, then go hang out with our adoptable cats in the Cat Zone Wed. - Sun. from 10AM - 7PM. Learn more about our cafe and foster program at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
