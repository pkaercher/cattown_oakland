We knew a sweet lady like Hera wouldn't be at the cafe long! She was more than happy to walk right into her carrier when her new mom came to pick her up earlier today as adoption No. 355. Congratulations to them both, and thank you to everyone who visited this week! We're closed tomorrow and Tuesday in order to get new cats acclimated to the space, but you can still go ahead and schedule your visit for Wed. - Sun. or make a tax-deductible donation to our non-profit cat rescue at www.cattownoakland.org! =^･.･^=
