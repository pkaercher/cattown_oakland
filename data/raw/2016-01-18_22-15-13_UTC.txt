Our Foster Program had quite a busy weekend too! Jimmy, Butch, and Harlow were very shut down at the shelter, but thanks to our awesome fosters, these three  "unadoptable" cats were able to relax in a temporary home and found their new families this weekend! If you're interested in fostering for Cat Town, check out our 'cats needing fosters' page at www.cattownoakland.org! We're always looking for new foster homes here in Oakland, and the cats need you help >^. .^<
