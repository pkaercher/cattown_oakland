The Cat Zone opens in just a few minutes and Buttercup can't wait! She's already on the lookout for the perfect playmate. Come meet this spunky gal and the rest of our adoptable cats today from 10AM to 7PM at 2869 Broadway! You can book your visit online at www.cattowncafe.org to guarantee your entry at your desired time (all  reservation-donations support our non-profit cat rescue)! =^･.･^=
