Can you think of a better way to spend the afternoon than petting and getting to know adorable (and adoptable!) cats? If you answered no (and if you're reading this, you probably did), then head down to 2869 Broadway for a snack and some quality time with the 18 cats currently in our Cat Zone. We're open until 7PM this evening, but don't worry, if you just don't have time today, you can schedule your visit for later in the week at www.cattowncafe.org! =^･.･^=
