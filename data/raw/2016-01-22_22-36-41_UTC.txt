Omar's been having a blast playing with everybody today! Come get out of the rain and get to know him and the rest of the current cafe cats - it's a double win! We're open until 7PM tonight, but if you can't make it in today, you can learn about all the cats available for adoption in the cafe and foster program by visiting www.cattownoakland.org! =^･.･^=
