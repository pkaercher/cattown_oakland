Happy Caturday! In celebration, Lucy, Jeremiah, Marlo, and Bailey have formed a four cat cuddle puddle to get the day rolling. Come see for yourself when we open at 10AM! We've got hot drinks, yummy eats, and 15 adoptable cats, so beat the weekend crowds by reserving your visit at www.cattowncafe.org! =^･.･^=
