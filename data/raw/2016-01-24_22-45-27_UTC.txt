Forgot to post that Cat Zone favorite Onara was adopted earlier this week! That makes adoption No. 360 from the 1st Cat Cafe in the USA. We're open until 7PM tonight, and have several walk-in spots available for the rest of the afternoon, so swing by 2869 Broadway and hang out with our adoptable cats >^. .^<
