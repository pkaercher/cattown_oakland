Lotus is a year old tabby who spent about a week and a half in the back of OAS before we pulled her for the cafe. She quickly became a staff and volunteer favorite, and is now headed home as adoption No. 361! Check out all the cats available for adoption from the cafe and our foster program at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
