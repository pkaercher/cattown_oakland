After spending 3 months in a cage, Cat Town finally busted Sunday out of the shelter. She landed in a foster home, where she was greeted by a sweet couple who have the patience and kindness to let her decompress and blossom. We are all very excited to see who she will be outside of a cage! Help more cats like Sunday by becoming a foster or supporting our non-profit cat rescue at www.cattownoakland.org/donate >^. .^<
