Meet Colombo! He's around 6 years old and was brought to the shelter with an old eye injury and a gnarly abscess (top left), but after a bit of treatment and recovery, he is now looking for a new family in the Cat Zone. He's not a huge fan of being in such a big space, but is a huge fan of laps! So come meet him this weekend and see if he's the right fit for your home >^. .^<
