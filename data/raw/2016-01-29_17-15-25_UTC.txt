We knew Pebble wouldn't last very long in the Cat Zone... Alex here saw her and came to meet her on Wednesday right when she got off work. She finalized the paperwork, went home to get her house ready, and picked her up last night! That makes adoption No. 362 from the Cat Town Cafe, and you can check out all the cats in our Cafe and Foster Program at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt >^. .^<
