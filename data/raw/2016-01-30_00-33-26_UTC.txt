Cleo (top) and Omar are recharging in their favorite hangout after the excitement of the morning! A sister and brother duo, these two know life is better with your best pal by your side. Come warm up with a hot drink and meet these siblings in the Cat Zone today or this weekend from 10AM to 7PM. Visit www.cattowncafe.org to make a reservation-donation and support our non-profit cat rescue in the process! =^･.･^=
