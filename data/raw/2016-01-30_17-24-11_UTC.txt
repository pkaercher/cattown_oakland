It's Caturday! Celebrate appropriately by heading down to 2869 Broadway to meet our 15 adoptable cats, including Spencer (pictured) and his brother, Nigel! Stay one step ahead of weekend crowds by making a reservation-donation for your visit at www.cattowncafe.org, and join us this weekend from 10AM to 7PM. =^･.･^=
