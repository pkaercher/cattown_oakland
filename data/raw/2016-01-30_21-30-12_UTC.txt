Howie is a long haired, FIV+, 4 year old, who came to us after being at Hayward Animal Services for over 7 months. Now he's looking for a nice family to go home with here at the 1st Cat Cafe in the U.S.! Come meet him this weekend at 2869 Broadway, and check out all of our adoptable cats at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
