Sweet Mars also left as adoption No. 365! Here she is with her new mom (and Cat Zone volunteer!), Jessica J. We'll be closed tomorrow to help get new cats acclimated to our space, but you can still learn about all the cats available for adoption in both the cafe and foster program by visiting www.cattownoakland.org/adopt! =^･.･^=
