We are in URGENT NEED of a new foster, foster-to-adopt, or permanent home for 3 year old Sophia! This sweet girl needs a home where she can be who she is. She needs to be an only cat and is happiest when her humans are around. Never fostered before? No problem! Cat Town provides all the necessary supplies (food, litter, toys, etc.), all vet care and support. If you can help Sophia, send an email to info@cattownoakland.org asap >^. .^<
