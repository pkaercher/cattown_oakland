Can you foster (or adopt!) Faith? She's a crazy sweet 4 year old longhaired calico, who needs a quite home to land in after her spay appointment tomorrow afternoon. We're looking for a home where she can be the only cat, and one without young kids (or very cat savvy ones!). If this sounds like you, reach out to info@cattownoakland.org and please tag or share with your friends >^. .^<
