Howie is ready for visitors! In an experiment to make the Cat Zone experience more enjoyable for humans (and for the cats!) we've lowered our occupancy to 10 people in the space at a time. So, guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone this week at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com and know that your donation supports our non-profit cat rescue >^. .^<
