Tanner came to Cat Town in late November after being brought to the shelter with a broken leg. He needed surgery and a couple months in a @cattownoakland foster home to recover before making his way to the Cat Zone. Of course once he got here it took 0 time for him to work his magic, and he's now headed home as adoption No. 369!
