Tyler (the tux) and Marlo are a bonded pair looking for a foster home to relax and enjoy some quiet time in.  These sweet cats have been at the Cat Town Cafe for about a month and are feeling overwhelmed by all the cats and people.  Before that, they were surrendered to the Oakland Animal Shelter by their guardians and it's all just too confusing for them.  Please contact info@cattownoakland.org if you can foster these two awesome cats >^. .^<
