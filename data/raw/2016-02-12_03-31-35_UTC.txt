Little Iggy spent over 45 days at the shelter where he was stressed and considered feral. One of our rescue partners was going to integrate him into a feral colony, but as soon as he left the shelter he started purring and making biscuits... so we decided to give him a chance here at Cat Town. 
Now, he's headed out the door as adoption No. 370 with his new dad, Kevin. We couldn't help all these awesome cats without your support! So pay us a visit here at the Cafe this weekend, or make a tax-deductible donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate to help us continue our work! >^. .^<
