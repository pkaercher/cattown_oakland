Thanks to everyone who reached out about fostering Tyler and Marlo! These two are now in a new temporary home and are doing GREAT! The cafe just isn't for every cat, and as soon as Tyler came out of the carrier he was purring, taking pets, and giving elevator butt! If you're interested in fostering for Cat Town and live in the East Bay, check out how to become a foster at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
