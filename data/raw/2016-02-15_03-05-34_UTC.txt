Akbar and Jeff had been in the shelter for 3 months before coming to Cat Town. Once here, they made themselves at home in the upstairs of one of our Cat Zone houses. It took about two weeks for us to find the right people for them, but now they're headed home as adoption No. 372 and 373! Thanks to everyone for visiting this week, and Happy Valentine's Day >^. .^<
