Remember Jeff and Akbar who got adopted yesterday? Well their new dad should get a "Boyfriend Of The Year" award for this amazing way of telling their new mom that she was coming to Cat Town to get a cat! We open again for the week on Wednesday at 10AM, so check out all the cats we've got available for adoption and guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
