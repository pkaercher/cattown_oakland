Jake was going to make his debut in the Cat Zone tomorrow, but his plans changed when one of our volunteers wanted to introduce him to her parents. They came in today to meet him, and now he's adoption No. 374! Guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone and come play with all of our adoptable cats when we open tomorrow at 10AM at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
