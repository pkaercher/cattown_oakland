This is Dorian, he had spent over two months in the back of the shelter before coming to Cat Town. He was in the Cat Zone for about 2 hours before meeting an awesome family... They'd been wanting to adopt for a while, but were waiting to find the right cat and were smitten with him! Now he's saying goodbye to everyone as he heads home as adoption No. 376!
