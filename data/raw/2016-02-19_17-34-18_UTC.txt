Panda is a 4 year old male who came to Cat Town with a broken leg. We helped get him the surgery he needed, and gave him time to recoup in our foster program. Now he's looking for his new family here at 2869 Broadway! Panda still has a lot of energy for play, but loves a good head scratch. 
Come meet him this weekend, and support our non-profit cat rescue by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
