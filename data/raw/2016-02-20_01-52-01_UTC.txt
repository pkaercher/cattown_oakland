Sparrow has made some amazing progress since she came to Cat Town in November. We're hoping we can find her a home with another cat she can befriend, and patient people. If you see her in the Cat Zone, grab a feather toy and see if she's in the mood to play! We're open this weekend from 10AM - 7PM, learn more at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
