Idaho is about 11 years old and was surrendered to OAS after his caretaker passed away. He is as sweet as can be, and is looking for a new lap he can call home! If you're looking for a friendly and mellow cat, Idaho is your guy. Come spend Caturday in the Cat Zone and meet all of our adoptable cats from 10AM - 7PM at 2869 Broadway >^. .^<
