Come say hello to our volunteers at the #WFMOaklandGives event at @wholefoodsmarketoakland and grab a free coffee drink ticket! We're here  until 3PM. And if you shop at Whole Foods, make sure to make your grocery run this Thursday 2/25 because 1% of the days sales will be donated to Cat Town! Thanks to everyone who voted for us >^. .^<
