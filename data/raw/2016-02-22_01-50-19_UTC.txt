Panda came to the shelter with a leg injury (he was likely hit by a car), the leg had to be rebroken so it could be set to heal correctly. After his surgery, he spent a couple of weeks recovering in a Cat Town foster home before being brought to the Cafe. Now, he's headed home as adoption No. 381! If you love seeing all these great adoption stories, please consider making a tax-deductible donation at www.cattownoakland.org... We (the cats and people of Cat Town) couldn't do this work without your support >^. .^<
