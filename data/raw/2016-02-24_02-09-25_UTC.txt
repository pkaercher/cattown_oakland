Did you ever get to meet Omar & Cleo? These two are a perfect example of how our cafe, and the people who visit it, are changing lives! C&O came to us a few months ago and were very under socialized. At first they learned by watching the more social cats... How to play, get treats, then got more and more comfortable being pet thanks to our volunteers, and YOU, the people who visit the Cat Zone. Now, they're headed home as adoption No. 382 and 383! Visit us tomorrow starting at 10AM and help support our non-profit cat rescue by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
