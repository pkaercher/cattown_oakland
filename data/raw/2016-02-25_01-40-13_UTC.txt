Idaho got surrendered to the shelter after his caretaker passed away a few weeks ago. Cat Town's main focus is special needs and senior cats, so we were happy to help give this guy a second chance at finding a family. Looks like he did just that, and is headed home as Adoption No. 384! Learn more about Cat Town and support our work by making a tax-deductible donation at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
