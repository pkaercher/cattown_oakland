Giselle came to Cat Town after being in the back of the shelter for a few weeks. She was definitely stressed there, so we gave her about two weeks to decompress and get socialized with our volunteers before sending her into the Cat Zone. She wound up becoming SO sweet, and it only took her a couple of days to meet her new mom, Ashley. Now she's adoption No. 385 from the Cat Town Cafe >^. .^<
