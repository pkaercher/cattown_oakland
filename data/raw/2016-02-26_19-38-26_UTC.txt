This is Monty, he's about a year old, and was surrendered to the shelter after being found outside of a liquor store in Oakland. He's a little shy at first (and can generally be found hanging out in the quiet zone), but once he sniffs you, he loves being pet! Come meet him this weekend and support our cat rescue by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
