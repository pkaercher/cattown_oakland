Spencer had a couple of caturday-catnip-tacos from Tacos Por Los Gatos this morning. Come grab a cup of coffee, try one of our new breakfast burritos, and play with our adoptable cats. The Cat Zone is open at 10AM, and you can guarantee your entry by booking on-line at www.cattowncafe.org or try your luck as a walk-in at 2869 Broadway >^. .^<
