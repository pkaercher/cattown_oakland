We pulled 9 year old Hazel from the shelter a few days ago and were going to wait until next week to put her in the Cat Zone, but She was so sweet and out going that we decided to let her loose a little early... First thing she did was plop into someones lap! Come meet her today until 7PM or e-mail us at info@cattownoakland.org if you'd like to meet her while we're closed tomorrow and Tuesday >^. .^<
