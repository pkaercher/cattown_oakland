We're closed today, so we can help new cats (like Hopper here from our friends at @feralchange) adjust to life in the Cat Zone. But, you can still make a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.org to support our non-profit cat rescue and guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone or for this weeks #CatZoneYoga class >^. .^<
