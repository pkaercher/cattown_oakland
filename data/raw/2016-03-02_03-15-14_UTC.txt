Got this awesome update from adoption No. 49 yesterday! "This is Luna (originally named Melody) and she was adoption #49 from the cafe. She is the little love my life, thank you guys so much for bring us together!" - Alex M.

Visit us and meet your own best friend when we open the cafe tomorrow morning at 10AM. Make a reservation-donation to guarantee your entry at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
