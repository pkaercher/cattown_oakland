We're closed today and tomorrow... but if you're looking for adoptable cats, you can always head to www.cattownoakland.org to see everyone in our cafe and foster program!

We get asked about the artwork in the Cat Zone a lot too, so we want to give a special shout out to @derp1er_, @somnipotentone, and our friends at @fuming_guerilla_productions for putting together the incredible murals that are in the Cat Zone >^. .^<
