Can you lend Panda a hand? Do you have a spare room with very little furniture or few high spaces to jump off? Then get in touch with info@cattownoakland.org ! Panda was treated for a leg injury after we got him from the shelter, but it turns out his other hip is going to need work too. So, he'll need a very mellow home to recoup in for a few months. Is that with you? Cat Town will provide you with support and all the necessary supplies, if you can provide him a home >^. .^<
