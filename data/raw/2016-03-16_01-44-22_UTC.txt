Catching up on a few adoptions that happened this past week... Simba, Peanut, Hopper, Ramen, and Sabrina all found homes, which brings our adoption total from the cafe to 394! We couldn't do this work without your support... So help us reach our new $20,000 fundraising challenge at www.cattownoakland.org/donate. If we raise the $20,000 by March 25th, a generous donor has offered to give us an extra $10,000! No donation is too small, and all funds go towards helping take care of cats while they wait to find a new home at Cat Town >^. .^<
