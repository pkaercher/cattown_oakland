Saturn wants you to help Cat Town hit a new $20,000 fundraising challenge! If we reach $20k by March 25th, a generous donor has offered to give us an extra $10,000. That money means we can help more cats like Saturn, who came from the shelter with a batch of cats who had ringworm and were very under socialized. We put him into our foster program, treated him for ringworm, got him comfortable with people, and now he's looking for a home at the Cat Town Cafe!Donate today at www.cattownoakland.org/donate >^. .^<
