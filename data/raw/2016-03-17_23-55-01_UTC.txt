This is Maisy, she's a 10 year old, who was surrendered to the shelter because she was showing signs of having IBS. We just pulled her today, will be changing her diet and getting her checked up while we look for a foster or adoptive home for her. Could that be with you? E-mail info@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in helping this wonderful old lady >^. .^<
