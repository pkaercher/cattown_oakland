Babette was another one of the under socialized ringworm cats we pulled from OAS last November. After a few months of treatment and getting socialized in our foster program, we decided to move her into the cafe where she is learning to play and trust people more and more each day! Come spend time with our 18 adoptable cats today from 10AM - 7PM at 2869 Broadway >^. .^<
