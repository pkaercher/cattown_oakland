Meet Leo and Bella, this dynamic duo was sent to the shelter after their caretaker passed away, and are so very shell shocked by the whole ordeal. If you have the ability to house these two, they would much appreciate being out of the shelter and back in a home! If you've got space for them and love to give, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
