The cafe is closed today, but you can still see all of the cats available for adoption at the cafe and in our foster program, as well as help us hit our $20,000 fundraising challenge at www.cattownoakland.org! Your donations keep us open and help sweet cats like Lucy (and her lurking friend Spencer) find new loving homes >^. .^<
