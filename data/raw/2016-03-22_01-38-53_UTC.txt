Looks like Spencer & Nigel made a killing with the taco truck this weekend, and they're donating it all to Cat Town for our $20k fundraising drive! Currently we're at about $13,000 of our goal, and you can help us hit our mark by donating today at www.cattownoakland.org/donate! If we get to $20,000 by the 25th, a Cat Town supporter will donate an extra $10,000 to us... so what are you waiting for? Donate right meow >^. .^<
