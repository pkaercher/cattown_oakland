After being in the back of the shelter for over a month, we brought Franklin to the cafe. He was hissy and very wary of people at OAS, but after a few weeks here, he let his guard down and started loving pets and playing with people! Now he's headed home as adoption No. 399. Help us give more cats like Franklin a 2nd chance by supporting us at www.cattownoakland.org/donate. If we hit $20,000 by Friday we get a bonus $10,000 from a VERY generous donor >^. .^<
