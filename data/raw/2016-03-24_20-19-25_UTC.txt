We're at just over $18,000 in our fundraising drive! To help push us over the $20,000 edge, @petfoodexpress is offering donors of $250 or more a chance to be a part of their "My Mutt" poster program. You donate to Cat Town, get a professional photoshoot with your cat or dog, and keep the giant print after it's hangs in a store. Plus, you get entered to have a private "Cocktails in the Cat Zone" party for you and 7 friends! Donate at www.cattownoakland.org/donate by Midnight tomorrow to be entered in the drawing >^. .^<
