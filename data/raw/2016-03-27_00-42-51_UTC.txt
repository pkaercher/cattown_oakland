Sparrow came to us in late November after spending two months in the shelter. She was very wary of people and under socialized... After spending a couple of weeks getting used to humans with our volunteers in our acclimation space, we moved her over to the Cat Zone. She turned into such a playful gal, thanks to all of our guests coming in and spending quality time playing with her, and is now headed home as adoption No. 400! Thanks to everyone who came by and spent Caturday with us, and remember we're closing at 3PM tomorrow >^. .^<
