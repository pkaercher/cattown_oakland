Getting a cat to pull a number out of a cup wasn't easy... But we finally have a winner for our 'Cocktails in the Cat Zone' fundraiser raffle. Congrats to Katherine Perry! 
Thanks again to everyone who donated, we were able to hit our goal and got an extra $10,000 donation that helps keeps our cats happy and our doors open. Have a safe and happy Caturday night everyone >^. .^<
