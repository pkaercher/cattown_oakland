Sydney & Po came to us via our friends at @feralchange and @oaklandanimalservices at the beginning of the month. They started out pretty shy and unsure of all the commotion in the cafe, but after a week,started getting comfortable and playful and are now headed home! See all of our adoptable cats in the cafe and foster program at www.cattownoakland.org and add a new member to your family >^. .^<
