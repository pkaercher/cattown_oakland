Hazel is back in the Cat Zone! You may remember she was adoption No. 389, but her adopters had to bring her back to us due to an unexpected and intense allergic reaction. They were very upset to have to bring her back and had nothing but the greatest things to say about her! Meet her today until 7PM at 2869 Broadway and take her home >^. .^<
