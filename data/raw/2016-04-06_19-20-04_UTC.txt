The Cat Zone is open for the week and our newest batch of cats are SUPER playful. It's been a very busy morning, and with some schools still being on spring break, we recommend making a reservation-donation to guarantee your entry! Do that and see all of the cats available for adoption at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
