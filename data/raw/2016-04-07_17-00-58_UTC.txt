Juliette spent nearly 5 months in the shelter before becoming a Cat Town cat. First we put her into our Foster Program so we could get to know her and see how good her vision was (turns out she sees great and is a heck of a player/hunter!), and now she's at the cafe looking for a new home. Meet her today from 10AM - 7PM at 2869 Broadway and see all of our cats available for adoption at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
