Celebrating #NationalPetDay with a very special adoption. I'll let volunteer Cathy N. tell you about it... "Today, Cat Town sends Spencer and Nigel to their forever home. These brothers are such a testament to the work Cat Town does. The photo on the top right was from the first day I met them, and was the only photo I got before they started retreating and hissing. It's taken some time, but now they're playful, interactive, and even allowing pets. Their transformation is a shining example of everything Cat Town works to do for under socialized cats. So, while we are sad to see them go, finding Spencer and Nigel a home is the greatest reward for all the hard work by Cat Town staff and volunteers. I know people don't come to Instagram to read, but their story is too good not to share." Huge thanks to everyone (staff, volunteers, and YOU, our Cat Zone visitors) who socialized these guys, and helped them grow into the awesome cats they are now. See all of the cats we've got up for adoption in our foster program and here at the cafe at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
