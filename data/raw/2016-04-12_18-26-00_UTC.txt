The cafe is closed today, but here's an AMAZING adoption story via our foster program [@cattownoakland] that happened this weekend... ADOPTED! Big Ben was brought to the shelter thru Fix Our Ferals. He clearly wasn't feral, but he was VERY depressed at the shelter. He also had an injured front paw that he wouldn't put weight on, so he was treated with antibiotics and pain meds. Once he was tested, we found out he was FIV+ and FELV+. Enter Jen and Matt. They just lost their beloved cat a month earlier, but were willing to open up their hearts to foster. They knew going in that Ben's prognosis would be poor, but they still wanted to help where it was needed most. As you can see in the bottom photos, it was practically love at first sight and there was an immediate bond with Ben and Matt. It wasn't long before they realized they couldn't let this super duper special cat be adopted by anyone else, Big Ben was already home! His new parents say, "Of course Ben's mustache is hard to resist, but we really fell in love with him because he's a sweet, goofy, loving kitty who will make us happy every day we have left with him." We have lots more wonderful cats like Ben who are still looking for their special someone(s). Check them out at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt >^. .^<
