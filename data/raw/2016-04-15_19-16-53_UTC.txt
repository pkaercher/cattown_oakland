Want to help a shelter cat find a new home? Then please consider fostering! We've got 4 cats that we'd like to pull from the shelter this weekend, but they need YOUR HELP. If you've got room in your home, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org and let us know you're interested in fostering. Cat Town provides all the supplies, vet visits, and support you need... and you provide a temporary loving home for the cats. Learn more about fostering with Cat Town at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
