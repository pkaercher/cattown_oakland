Like if you'd rather be lounging in a hammock,  than being at work on a Monday! 
The cafe is closed today, tomorrow, and Wednesday this week (more info on the special event happening on Wed. later...)! Guarantee your entry into the Cat Zone, sign up for #CatZoneYoga or our next #CatZoneMovieNight at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
