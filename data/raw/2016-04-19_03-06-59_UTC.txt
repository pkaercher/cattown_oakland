Want tickets for you and a friend to meet Key & Peele on 4/20 at the Cat Town Cafe? Then reshare this image of Hazel hanging with her new friend Keanu, tag #KeanusCatTownKrib, and follow the @cattowncafe! The meet and greet starts at 3PM (so make sure you're free at that time when you're entering), and tickets are SOLD OUT!  We'll be choosing our winner tomorrow at 4PM, good luck to all, and remember to #AdoptAGangstaPet >^. .^<
