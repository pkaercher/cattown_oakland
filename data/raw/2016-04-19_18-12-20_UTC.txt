Don't forget! If you want to win tickets for you and a friend to meet Key & Peele on 4/20 at  Cat Town, then reshare this image of Jeremiah and his new bud Keanu, tag #KeanusCatTownKrib, and follow the @cattowncafe! The meet and greet starts at 3PM (so make sure you're free at that time when you're entering), and tickets are SOLD OUT!  We'll be choosing our winner today at 4PM. Good luck to all, and remember to #AdoptAGangstaPet >^. .^<
