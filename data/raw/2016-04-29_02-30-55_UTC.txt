This is Maria Callas! She was trapped from a colony at Mills College, and like her namesake, has quite a singing voice. She's probably a bit too shy to come here to the cafe, but we'd love to see her get adopted out at @oaklandanimalservices! This is her hanging out in the catio at the shelter, visit the shelter this weekend from 12PM - 5PM to meet her >^. .^<
