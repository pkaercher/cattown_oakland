Here’s Cat Town Adoption Councilor Jill E. finalizing the paper work for another adoption! Spot (seen curled up on the scratcher) was found living in a stray colony, trapped and neutered, but decided he didn’t want to return out to the wild! 
Thanks to everyone at @yoloanimalshelter who gave this guy a chance, and a little extra promotion from Cat Town, he’s now headed to his permanent home! Happy Caturday everyone >^. .^<
