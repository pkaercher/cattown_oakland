This one is kinda urgent y'all... Meet 13 year old lady cat, Twiggy. She was surrendered to be euthanized after she stopped using her litter box when she got too stressed by some new cats that moved into her home. Luckily we met her, got her into our Foster Program, where we found her to be a totally wonderful cat, with no litter box issues whatsoever, once she was back to being the only cat in the house. 
Twiggy needs to be moved by Friday night, so if you've got space in your home (even temporary!) shoot an e-mail to info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
