Elsa has been in the Cat Zone for couple of weeks now... She came to us a bit undersocialized, but has been getting more active and interested in playing with the rainbow dancer! Itâ€™s always awesome to see how the cats start to learn as they interact with each other and our guests, so come help us socialize 13 adoptable cats today from 10AM - 6PM before #CatZoneYoga >^. .^<
