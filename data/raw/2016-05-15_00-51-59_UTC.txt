Teddy is one of the super sweet fellas that came to us from @yoloanimalshelter. He was brought to the shelter with a broken leg and was tagged as a feral cat, but while he was recovering from surgery he showed the volunteers his true colors, and is now celebrating Caturday by heading home with his new mom and dad! We've still got 12 adoptable cats in the Cat Zone, so visit us tomorrow from 10AM - 7PM >^. .^<
