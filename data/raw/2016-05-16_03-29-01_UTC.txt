Sweet Stow spent the first bit of her life having the run of the American Steel warehouse with our friends at @feralchange, then she graduated to the Cat Zone about three weeks ago where she got to meet lots of new people... including the two above who are now taking her home! 
We'll be closed tomorrow and Tuesday, but you can still see all of our adoptable cats and support our life saving work at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
