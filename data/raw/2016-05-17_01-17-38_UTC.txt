Meet our new foster of the week, Coral! When @cattownoakland first took Coral from the Oakland shelter, she had zero confidence and was beyond nervous about being touched. After an unpleasant waylay at the vet's to remove nine rotten teeth (!!) we whisked her into the arms of her caring foster mom Diane, where she has blossomed into such an amazing lady.

Coral has been in our care for almost two years (!) and is now around 12, so we're super enthused to get her into her permanent and loving home.
