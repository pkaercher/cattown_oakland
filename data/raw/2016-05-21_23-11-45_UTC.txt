We have a Caturday emergency for Orson! This little guy is amazingly sweet and playful, and is looking for a new foster home... If you live in Oakland (or the immediate area), have some daytime flexibility so we can get him to the vet, and are comfortable putting medicine in his food, you might be the right fit! As with all our fosters, Cat Town provides all supplies and trips to the vet, and you provide a good home. Reach out to info@cattownoakland.org if you can help >^. .^<
