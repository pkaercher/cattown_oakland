Lots of people ask us if we have kittens at the cafe, but since adult cats and unvaccinated kittens can't mix, we don't... But our partners at @oaklandanimalservices do, and they need new fosters ASAP! Contact oas@oaklandnet.com to find out how you can get involved and help socialize some temporary fur children before they're ready to be adopted!
