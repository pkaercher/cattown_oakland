We've got 22 adorable cats up for adoption in the Cat Zone this week! Come meet them Wed. - Sun. from 10AM - 7PM (except for Thursday, when we close early for #CatZoneYoga!). Support our nonprofit rescue by making a reservation-donation at www.cattowncafe.appointy.com and come play with our cats >^. .^<
