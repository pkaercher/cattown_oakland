Meet Solomon,  he's been at OAS for around 3 months. He came in to the shelter with some minor leg pain, which the vets think is chronic arthritis in the knee. We're looking to get him into foster home ASAP! Could that be with you? If you're interested in helping this great guy out, email info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
