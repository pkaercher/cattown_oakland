We have a few special art pieces going up in the Cafe this week that highlight some of our long-term foster cats (seen here). Come check it out when we open for the week on Wednesday, then adopt one of these cats and get an awesome original piece of art to boot! See all of our cats in the cafe and foster program (@cattownoakland) at www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
