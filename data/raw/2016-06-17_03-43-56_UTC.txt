We sprung Solomon from the shelter! The humans of Cat Town couldn't help all of these amazing cats without the support of our community, so we want to give a huge THANK YOU to everyone who reached out or shared Solomon's story. If you want to learn more about fostering or support us by making a tax-deductible donation (so we can help more cats like Sol), then head over to www.cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
