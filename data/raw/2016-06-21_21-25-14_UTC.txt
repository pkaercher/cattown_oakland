Huge shout out to @petfoodexpress, @hellonulo, our volunteer coordinator @jay_roel1979, and the 4 volunteers who helped bring this huge donation of food and litter to the cats in the cafe and our foster program! We could not do all this without the communities support, so head to www.cattownoakland.org to learn how to get involved >^. .^<
