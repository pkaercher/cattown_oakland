This is Maria Callas, she's been in the shelter for over 100 days! We think the cafe would be too stressful for her, but would LOVE to help get her adopted! If you don't mind a talkative cat, and happen to have some safe outdoor space she could access, e-mail info@cattownoakland.org! We would happily consider a foster for her too since she's been in a cage for 100+ days. Lets get this girl a home >^. .^<
