We said "Aloha" to our buddy Kapaa today! This guy and 6 other cats came to us via a connection made between @bestfriendsanimalsociety, Cat Town, and the Kauai Community Cat Project (the equivalent to Feral Change, but in Hawaii!). The island doesn't have a ton of adopters, so we were happy to help these wonderful cats find homes here on the mainland! Come socialize with our 19 adoptable cats tomorrow from 10AM - 7PM, and guarantee your entry at www.cattowncafe.org >^. .^<
