Can you foster Smith? Cat Town covers all vet visits and supplies, you provide a temporary home while we find him the right family. He's gotta leave his current house no later than Tuesday, so we're looking for an Oakland based foster with no other cats in the house. Interested?! Then e-mail info@cattownoakland.org >^. .^<
