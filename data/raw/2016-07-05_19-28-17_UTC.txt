Today starts the Saving Pets Challenge! Please help Cat Town win the 2016 Saving Pets Challenge, so we can save more cats like Po, Spencer, and Nigel... who were all adopted out of the Cat Town Cafe this spring after being in the shelter for several months. Donate or join our team at bit.ly/spccattown this week, and we can win an extra $10K to help the cats who need us most!
