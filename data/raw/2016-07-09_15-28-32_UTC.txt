Had our first three-fer from the cafe this week! Rav and Mig came to us from Yolo County Animal Services, and over the last couple of weeks, Tilly (from OAS) got to be pretty good friends with them. Now, we're happy to report they were all adopted together to an amazing woman who had lost her three senior cats last year, and was ready to give another three cats a loving home.
