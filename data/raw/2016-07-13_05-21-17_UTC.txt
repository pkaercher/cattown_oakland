Huge thanks to everyone who donated during this first week of the Savings Pets Challenge! We raised nearly $30,000 in the first week, and to celebrate we pulled Cosmo from the shelter! He just landed in his foster home (thanks Sarit!) and we couldn't be happier for him! If you want to help more cats like Cosmo, consider fostering for us or donating at bit.ly/spccattown >^. .^<
