Meeka needs a new foster home (or adopter) ASAP!

If you've ever wondered about fostering, Meeka would be a great first experience. Cat Town provides all supplies for foster, will deliver her, and are available for any questions or concerns that might arise during her stay with you.

If you're in Oakland/Berkeley/Emeryville, and have the room and time to spare, then reach out to info@cattownoakland.org! 
You can learn more about this wonderful senior lady at cattownoakland.org/meeka >^. .^<
