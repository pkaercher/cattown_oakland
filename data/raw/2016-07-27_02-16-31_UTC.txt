Have you donated to the Saving Pets Challenge yet? Until Aug. 4th, every donation of $500 or more gets you and a guest an invite to a special 'Cocktails in the Cat Zone' after hours party (including if you've already donated!) at the Cat Town Cafe!  In addition to the $10K we can win if we're still in 4th place on Aug 4, the team that raises the most from July 26 to Aug 2 will get an extra $5k.
