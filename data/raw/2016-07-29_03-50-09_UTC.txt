We're so happy to share that Birdie, who was in the shelter for three months, was adopted last night. Help more cats like her go from shelter, to Cat Town, to home, by donating to the Saving Pets Challenge at bit.ly/spccattown! Every donation of $25 or more gets you a chance to win a Campout in the Cat Zone. Good luck >^. .^<
