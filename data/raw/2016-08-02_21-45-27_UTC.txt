Alright cats and kittens, not only did Jay make it back to Oakland in one piece... he helped push us back into 4th place (meaning, we're in the running for a $10,000 bonus)! There's just a few days left in the Saving Pets Challenge to keep us eligible for the bonus, so join our team and be a part of our life changing work at bit.ly/spccattown >^. .^<
