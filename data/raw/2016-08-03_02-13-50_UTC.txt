Jade has been at the shelter for over two months... now, thanks to your support, she is headed to a @cattownoakland foster home and will be available for adoption soon. You can help get more special needs cats like Jade out of the shelter by donating to our Saving Pets Challenge at bit.ly/spccattown. If we're still in 4th by August 4th, we can get a bonus $10,000! We (the humans and the cats of Cat Town) appreciate all of your support >^. .^<
