Ava is reaching out for a foster, is that you?! She's five years old, and came to the shelter with a fractured femur and paralyzed tail... That clearly hasn't slowed her down, because she loves people and just wants to sit on your lap!

We've got a vet appointment for her on Monday morning, and need a place for her to land Monday night! E-mail info@cattownoakland.org if you want to learn more about fostering this sweet lady >^. .^<
