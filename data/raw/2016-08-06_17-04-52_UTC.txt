This curious and friendly lady is Rivers. She's been spending time in our second space next door to the Cat Zone, building her confidence with the help of our volunteers. If you’re interested in adopting her, and her bonded partner, Kimbra, make an appointment by reaching out to info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
