Ava is out of the shelter! We picked her up this morning, got her into the vet (who says she doesn’t have an entropion eyelid, or need her tail amputated) and is now in her new foster home. Huge thanks to everyone who reached out about her, we couldn’t have gotten her out of the shelter without YOU!
