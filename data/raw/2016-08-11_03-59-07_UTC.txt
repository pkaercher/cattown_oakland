We've had a small out break of ringworm (not in the Cat Zone luckily!) and we're looking for a few temporary fosters for these unfortunate guys. Ringworm is essentially athletes foot, and can spread between animals, which is why they need to be isolated.  When proper precautions are taken, the likelihood of ringworm spreading is very low.  We've got three cats (a pair and a single) who we're looking to place in foster homes. We will provide you with all the necessary meds, supplies, and support... if you can provide a recovery space (bathrooms are ideal). E-mail info@cattownoakland.org if you can help!
