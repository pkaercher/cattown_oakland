Some of the cats you meet in the Cafe have previously spent time with one of our fosters, working on their confidence and positive human interactions. Bastet is one of those cats, and now she's ready to meet her future family. Come spend your Sunday with our 13 Cat Zone residents and be sure to guarantee your entry by making a reservation donation online at www.cattowncafe.org
