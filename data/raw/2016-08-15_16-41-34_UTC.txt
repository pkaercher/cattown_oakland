If you've visited the Cafe recently, you might have met Elsa. She can usually be found tucked away in one of the cat structures, but lately has been venturing out for play time with our guests. These interactions are a huge part of our mission to help under socialized cats build positive relationships with humans. Come visit with Elsa in the Cat Zone when we open on Wednesday morning at 10AM and help this lovely lady keep building her confidence 🐈
