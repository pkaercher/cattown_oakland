Some of you may remember Panda, who came to Cat Town in the fall of last year in need of surgery on his back legs. Today, he's fully recovered, and enjoying life in his new home, where he enjoys a comfy bed and plenty of window spots for observing the world. Want to help us keep helping cats like Panda?
