If this isn't the picture of relaxation, we don't know what is! And to think that Sunday was utterly shut down at the shelter when we first met her. Now she roams the Cat Zone with confidence, soaking up pets and playtime. That's what Cat Town is all about - giving cats the opportunity to reveal their true personalities outside the shelter cage. Help our continued rescue efforts by making a reservation donation to spend some time in the Cat Zone at www.cattowncafe.org 🐈
