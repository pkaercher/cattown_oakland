Repost from volunteer @childlikespirit who captured Aaliyah's major progress over the weekend. As you can see here, she's now venturing out for play and interaction. Big thanks to our volunteers and visitors who help socialize our rescue cats during their time with Cat Town. Visit www.cattownoakland.org/get-involeved to find out about volunteer opportunities 🐈
