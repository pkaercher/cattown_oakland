One of our favorite sights to see - an adopter signing the final paperwork! We couldn't be more excited for Baxter to find his permanent home. When we first met him at the shelter, he was very outgoing, but had trouble bitting, making him a tricky case for adoption. But we were able to bring him to a loving foster home, where he was able to grow and learn how to interact with people and cats. Now he's found his new family and we couldn't be more excited!
