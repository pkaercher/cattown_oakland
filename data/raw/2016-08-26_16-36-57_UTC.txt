We'll be closing the Cafe a little early today for a special event in the Cat Zone, but Sunday is hoping you'll stop by 2869 Broadway before 3pm and say hello to her and all our adoptable cats. If you can't make it in today, be sure to make a reservation donation online at www.cattowncafe.org and secure your entry into the Cat Zone over the weekend 🐈
