#FixOurFerals is dedicated to trap-neuter-return efforts and is ground zero in controlling the cat population in the East Bay. They are an integral part of our rescue and we could not operate without them. To support the re-opening and sustainability of their Spay-Neuter Center, @maddiesfund has awarded them a matching grant of up to $50,000 for all donation made to their ongoing fundraiser, now through October 15th. Help make a huge difference in controlling the overpopulation of cats and double your impact by donating to this vital cause via http://ow.ly/iSdt303Ds28 🐈
