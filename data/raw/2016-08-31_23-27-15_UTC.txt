#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday - Monty (pictured left) spent some time in the Cat Zone last spring. He was under socialized, but loved the company of other cats, and started partaking in play and pets before being adopted. His family sent along a recent update on his very happy ending - "About three weeks or so ago, Monty decided that he wanted to give this "pets" thing a try. Previously we'd just been able to pet him while he was eating, but only a little. But one day he approached, rubbed against [our] legs, and let himself be pet for quite awhile...Things have just progressed positively from there. Now he approaches us for pets, comes over when we call him - he seems to really enjoy our company - will follow us around, greets us at the door when we come home and has even begun to let us pick him up briefly...Really, Monty has turned out to be just the most gentle, patient, and sweet cat. He's bigger and way stronger than both Rori and Ozy, but he never bullies and always respects Rori's boundaries...His relationship with Ozy is especially cute; they groom and wrestle with each other all the time." üêà
