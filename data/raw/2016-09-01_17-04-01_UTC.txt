Sometimes, when cats come to Cat Town, we find out they’re better suited to go to a home where they’ll be an individual cat. Gavin is one of those cats, and he’s currently staying in Cat Zone 2, where volunteers can give him plenty of attention without him having to interact with the other Cat Zone residents. He is incredibly friendly, loves to be pet, and is up for adoption. If you’re interested in making him the newest member of your family, send an email to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a time to meet 🐈
