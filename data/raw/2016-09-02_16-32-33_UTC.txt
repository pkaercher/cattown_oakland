Spencer is one of our newest Cat Zone residents. He came to us through our friends at @feralchange, who discovered he was incredibly outgoing and people oriented, and now he's up for adoption. Come meet all of our adoptable cats when we open today at 10AM at 2869 Broadway, and be sure to make a reservation donation online at www.cattowncafe.org to secure your entry into the Cat Zone 🐈
