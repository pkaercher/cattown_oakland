Our dear friend, Adam Myatt, is leaving Cat Town to head out on his ‘Cat Man Across Ameowica’ road trip. While we’re sad to see him go, we’re also so excited to see what this journey brings him and know that when he makes his way back to Oakland, he’ll come stocked with stories about all his cat encounters across the country. If you work with a cat rescue, cat cafe, or just have a cat of your own, keep an eye out for him in your area. Follow Adam’s journey on his Instagram account @catmanofwestoakland. Best of luck, Cat Man! 🐈
