Sweet Ava recently came to Cat Town after 4 months at Oakland Animal Services. She had a few medical issues, including a paralyzed tail, and was in potential need of surgery. Our vet determined she would be fine without, and off she went to one of our foster homes. Then, this past weekend after just three short weeks with Cat Town, Ava found her new family! Way to go, Ava! To see all of our foster cats up for adoption, visit www.cattownoakland.org/adopt#cats-in-foster 🐈
