We open for the week in just a few short minutes and handsome Lancelot is ready to meet and greet. He came to Cat Town last week after spending over a year with our friends at @feralchange and now he's charming Cafe visitors left and right. We'll be open today from 10AM to 7PM, so come meet him and all of our adoptable cats at 2869 Broadway 🐈
