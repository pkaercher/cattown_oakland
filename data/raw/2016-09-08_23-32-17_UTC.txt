Harold's pretty excited about @koidestudio's handmade ceramics, now for sale in the Cafe store! We're proud to feature locally made pieces by Bay Area artists. And when you buy products for sale at the Cafe, a portion of the sale will aid in our continued rescue efforts. Be sure to check out our entire store everyday from 9:30AM to 7PM at 2869 Broadway 🐈
