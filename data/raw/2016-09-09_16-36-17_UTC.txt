Freddy came to Cat Town through our partners at @feralchange after being found outside a condo complex in Oakland (pictured left), where he was known by the name "Friendly". As you might have guessed by his former name, he was incredibly charming, and after a short time in the Cat Zone, went home with his new family late last week.
