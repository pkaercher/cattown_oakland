Breakthrough alert! After spending 4 months in the shelter, King is making huge strides with Cat Town. This handsome fella was previously untouchable - lunging, hissing, and swatting at anyone who came close to his cage. Shelter volunteers were baffled by his behavior, since they knew he was a gentle and loving cat in his previous home. And that's why Cat Town took a chance on him. We had a feeling his aggression was a reaction to his environment and not a reflection of his personality. And now, after a few weeks in CZ2 with our dedicated volunteers, King is accepting a few pets and starting to show off his gentle personality. He's still relearning to trust humans, but is making incredible progress in becoming himself again. If you're interested in making a difference in the lives of shelter cats, consider volunteering with us. Visit www.cattownoakland.org/get-involved#volunteer for more information üêà
