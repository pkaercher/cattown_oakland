We'll be closing at 3PM tomorrow so we can get ready for #MeowattheMoon, but Oreo wanted to remind everyone that you can still grab some @donutsavant in the Cafe at 2869 Broadway before we head out for the event. Be sure to secure your entry in to the Cat Zone by making a reservation-donation online at www.cattowncafe.org 🐈
