We're getting ready to head over to #MeowattheMoon, for a night of feline fun! If you haven't gotten tickets yet, there's still time to purchase them at a discounted rate online at www.Meow-at-theMoon.org. Be sure to wear your dancing shoes because DJ Tim Diesel and the John Brothers Piano Company will keep you moving all night long. And don't forget to come dressed in your best cat attire if you plan on entering the costume contest. We can't wait to get started and look forward to seeing you all there! 🐈
