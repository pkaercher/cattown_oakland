Helping build positive relationships with humans is a huge part of the Cat Town mission. That's why we depend on our volunteers, staff, and visitors like you, to help us socialize our cat population. Your visits to the Cat Zone make a difference in the lives of shelter cats in more ways than one. To make a reservation-donation, or learn about volunteer opportunities, please visit www.cattownoakland.org 🐈
