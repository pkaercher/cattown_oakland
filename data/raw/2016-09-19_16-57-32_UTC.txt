Jamie's decided to "work" from home this Monday morning. The Cafe will be closed today and tomorrow so we can acclimate new cats to the space and do some deep cleaning, but you can make a reservation donation online at www.cattowncafe.org to secure some time with Jamie, and all our adoptable cats, when we open back up on Wednesday morning 🐈
