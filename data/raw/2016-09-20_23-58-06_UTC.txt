Volunteer Ginny L., caught Penelope with a little extra pep in her step last Saturday as her adopter signed the final paperwork for her and her bonded partner, Qunicy. If you're looking to adopt, be sure to visit us at 2869 Broadway when we open for the week tomorrow morning at 10AM, and see all our cats available for adoption online at www.cattownoakland.org 🐈
