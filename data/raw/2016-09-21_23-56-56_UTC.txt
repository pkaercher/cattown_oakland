Did you know you can support Cat Town by donating items from our Amazon wish list? It's a great way to help us care for our foster and Cafe cats. We're especially in need of some new pet carriers, which we use for taking cats to the vet, bringing them from the shelter, and sending them to foster homes. If you'd like to make a donation, please visit bit.ly/cat-town-wish-list to see our entire Amazon wish list 🐈
