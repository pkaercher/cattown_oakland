Bonded buddies, Hank and Brodie, spent some time in our Cat Zone 2, building up their confidence with the help of our specially trained volunteers. Now they're waiting to meet their new family in the Cat Zone (or more specifically, the Quiet Zone) - could it be you?! Make a reservation donation online at www.cattowncafe.org to visit us at 2869 Broadway and find out! 🐈
