The relationship between foster families and their foster cats is very special. Fosters provide a safe space where cats can find their footing and build positive, trusting relationships with humans. Cats like Eugene (pictured here), would be no where without the patience, love and care given to him by his foster family. If you're interested in fostering with Cat Town, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org for more details 🐈
