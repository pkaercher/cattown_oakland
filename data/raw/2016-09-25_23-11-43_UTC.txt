Bonded pair, Molly and Lima, couldn't resist a lap if they tried! These affectionate, playful girls would make incredible pets for first time cat owners or families with kids. If you're looking for a pair to complete your family, come meet Molly and Lima at the Cafe, Wednesday through Sunday from 10AM to 7PM, or get in touch with us at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
