After being adopted to a family with other pets, it was learned that Mickey was better suited to be a solo cat, and he found himself back at the shelter. With the stress of the environment, Mickey was not a happy camper. That's why we brought him to a foster home yesterday, where he can wait for his new family as a happy, solo cat. If you'd like to help shelter cats in need and are interested in fostering, drop a line to info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
