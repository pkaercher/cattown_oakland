Another week of happy adoptions to report! From top left clockwise - Eugene, Castor, Eden, Einstein, Sinatra, and Briggs all found their new families through our foster program or through the Cat Town Cafe. You can see all our cats available for adoption online at http://www.cattownoakland.org/adopt 🐈
