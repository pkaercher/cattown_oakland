Progress report: Elsa's been building her confidence with Cat Town for a few months now, watching and learning from other cats in the space. Within the past few weeks she's made some major strides, coming out of the quiet zone to play with guests and volunteers, which helps her build positive relationships with humans. Come help Elsa, and our other Cafe cats, build their confidence today from 10AM to 7PM at 2869 Broadway 🐈
