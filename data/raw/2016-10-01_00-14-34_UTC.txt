Bonded pair, Molly and Lima, are eagerly waiting to find their new family - they've even picked out crates for the occasion! These two love playtime and cuddles equally, and are very easy going - they'd make a great pair of cats for a first time pet owner or a family with kids. And even better, adoption fees will be waived for the entire month of October to celebrate the Cafe's second anniversary! So if these two sound like the missing piece to your family's puzzle, come down to 2869 Broadway this weekend to meet them! 🐈
