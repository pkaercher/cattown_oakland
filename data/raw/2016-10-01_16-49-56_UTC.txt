For the entire month of October, we're celebrating the Cat Town Cafe's 2nd anniversary with waived adoption fees! Pending our usual interview process, approved adopters will be able to take home their new feline family member minus the usual fee. All our cats, including Zephyr here, can't wait to find their new families. You can see all our adoptable cats on our website at www.cattownoakland.org 🐈
