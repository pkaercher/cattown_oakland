Thank you to our visitors from @oaklandanimalservices who stopped by the Cafe this past Wednesday for a tour. Our longstanding relationship with OAS has been vital in our efforts to find loving homes for all of Oakland's shelter cats. Visit http://www.oaklandanimalservices.org/ to learn about volunteer and adoption opportunities at OAS 🐈
