Sweet, senior Bella has made a lot of progress since she first went to her foster home - where she was once scared and standoffish, she's now a confident, loving companion. Here she is with her foster family, enjoying a quiet morning cuddled on the couch. Find Bella's full profile at www.cattownoakland.org, or reach out to info@cattownoakland for details on adopting.
