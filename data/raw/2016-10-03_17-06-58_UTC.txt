Have you heard about our Forgotten Kitten Project? When kittens arrive at the shelter, limited resources can make it hard to give them all the attention they need to become fully socialized. That's why we depend on people like you to become fosters to FKP kittens. If you're looking to help make a difference, and have an adorable time doing so, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about fostering 🐈
