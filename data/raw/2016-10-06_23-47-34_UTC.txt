Sweet Pepe has been at the shelter for 4 months, and we'd like to get him into a foster home ASAP. We provide all the needed supplies, so if you can offer up even a small space for this gentle boy, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org or share with friends and family who you think might be able to foster 🐈
