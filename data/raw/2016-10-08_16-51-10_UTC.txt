Photo of the week goes to @toshisushi for capturing this great shot of Sunday, Hector, Aaliyah, and Molly in the Cafe last weekend (plus Iris in the background). The Cafe is already open and the Cat Zone opens at 10AM, so come spend your Caturday drinking great coffee in the company of great cats at 2869 Broadway 🐈
