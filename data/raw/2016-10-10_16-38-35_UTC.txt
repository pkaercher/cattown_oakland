Ever wonder what happens at Cat Town on our closed days? Well, a few different things - we give the Cat Zone a deep clean, we acclimate new cats to the space, and we spend time at @oaklandanimalservices, figuring out which cats are most in need of our resources. Take a peek inside one of our recent visits to the shelter here 🐈
