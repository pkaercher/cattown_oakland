This little guy is Chance and he is such a champ. After facing some difficult challenges - a tail injury, followed by an eye injury, and now feline Leukemia - he's still got an incredibly sweet disposition. That's why we're hoping to find him a foster home ASAP, so he can have a space outside the shelter to relax. If you can provide a temporary home for this 5 month old sweetheart, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org, or share this story with friends who may be able to help üêà
