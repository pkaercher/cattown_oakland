Handsome Trevor is one of the cats represented in our long term foster cat art show, up at the Cat Town Cafe. All the works have been generously donated by the artists and will go home with the cats when they're adopted. If you're interested in adopting through our foster program, be sure to visit www.cattownoakland.org to learn more, or reach out to info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
