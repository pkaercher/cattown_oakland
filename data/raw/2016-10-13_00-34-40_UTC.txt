You may have noticed that we recently changed our Instagram handle to @CatTownOAK. We did this to better reflect the stories and photos we're sharing about not only Cafe cats, but also foster cats, adoption updates, progress reports, shelter tales, and so much more. Thank you for following along and supporting the Cat Town mission! 🐈
