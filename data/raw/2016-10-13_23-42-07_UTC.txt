Madison is a sweet older girl looking for a kind family to call her own. She does have hypothyroid, and requires daily medicine, but she's so easy going that it's no burden on her caretaker. If you're interested in making this adorable purr machine a part of your family, reach out to info@cattownoakland.org, and check out her full profile on www.cattownoakland.org/madison in the meantime 🐈
