Judith (left) and Eva are part of our forgotten kittens project. They've been making big strides since arriving at Cat Town, first in our Cat Zone 2 next door, and now in our main space. Come meet them today until 7pm at 2869 Broadway, and learn more about the Forgotten Kitten Project on our website at www.cattownoakland.org 🐈
