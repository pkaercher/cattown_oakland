The fluffiest guy in town, Solomon, is looking for a comfortable home and a family to match. This senior guy absolutely loves playing with his feather wand toy and when play time is over, he'll curl up on the couch near by. He will need someone who can give him medication for a limp, and a relaxed environment would serve him best. If you're the person Solomon's been waiting for, reach out to info@cattownoakland.org, and be sure to visit his full profile at www.cattownoakland.org/solomon üêà
