Hank and Mac have decided that this rainy, Oakland afternoon calls for extra cuddles. We're almost at the end of our week at the Cafe, but will open back up on Wednesday morning at 9:30AM. Make a reservation-donation online at www.cattowncafe.org to secure your entry to the Cat Zone for the coming week.
