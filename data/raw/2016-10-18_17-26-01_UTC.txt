What an incredible week for adoptions, and especially for some of our bonded pairs. From left to right - bonded tween kittens, Eva and Judith, Jane, Nina (have you ever seen more excited adopters?!), Kip and Kade (two bonded tabbies), and bonded buddies, Hector and Iris - all went home with their new families over the past week. We couldn't be more excited to see all these wonderful cats find their new homes.
