#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Sweet Rue was a favorite among staff and volunteers during her time as a foster cat. Just a couple months back, she finally found her new family, and is loving life in her new home. Her adopter recently sent along this photo with a note reading, "I couldn't be happier to have her!!" Nothing quite like a happy ending! Are you interested in adopting? Visit www.cattownoakland.org/adopt to see a complete list of all our cats up for adoption 🐈
