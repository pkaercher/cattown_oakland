Cats who are bonded depend on each other for companionship, playtime, and growth. Sometimes a pair could be bonded because they are littler mates and get along great; other times it could be because the shyer of the two learns from the more confident parter. We've got nine bonded pairs between the Cafe and the foster program right now, and with adoption fees waived for the month of October, this is a great opportunity to give a pair of cats the loving home they deserve.
