Come celebrate the 2nd anniversary of the Cat Town Cafe this Saturday and Sunday at 2869 Broadway. We'll have tasty pastries from @rollingsloanes on Saturday, delicious curry bread from @itadakico on Sunday, and $2 coffees all weekend long! Plus, we'll have some (toy) cake in the Cat Zone so the cats can celebrate, too! Secure your Cat Zone entry by making a reservation-donation online at www.cattowncafe.org, and come celebrate with us! 🐈
