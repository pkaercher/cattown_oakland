Brodie can't believe it's already been 2 years since the Cat Town Cafe first opened! Come celebrate with us today and tomorrow from 9:30AM to 7PM, with special treats and $2 coffees in the Cafe. And don't forget, all adoption fees are waived for the entire month of October for approved adopters. Secure your Cat Zone entry with a reservation donation online at www.cattowncafe.org 🐈
