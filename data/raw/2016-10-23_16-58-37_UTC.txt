If you didn't get to stop by yesterday, be sure to come celebrate the 2nd anniversary of the Cat Town Cafe today at 2869 Broadway. We'll have $2 coffees all day, plus delicious treats from @itadakico. And be sure to make a reservation donation online at www.cattowncafe.org to secure your entry in to the Cat Zone 🐈
