Samantha is a total social butterfly - her fosters have called her the friendliest cat they've ever met. She's a big fan of pets, with chin and cheek scratches being her favorite - affection is the quickest way to this girls heart! Throw in some play time with her favorite feather wand toy, and you're sure to become her best friend. If you're the new family Samantha's been looking for, get in touch with us at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
