Today, on the official 2nd anniversary of the Cat Town Cafe, we could not be more excited to re-cap such a fantastic weekend, full of adoptions. Five kittens including 2 bonded pairs, and four long-term  Cat Zone residents, including another bonded pair, all found their homes since this past Friday. From top left, clockwise - Elliot & Elwood (bonded), Sunday, Huck & Jim (bonded), Mac & Aaliyah (bonded), EZ, and Cory, made for 9 total adoptions. Thank you to all who have helped us find homes for Oakland's at-risk shelter population since the Cafe's opening and before. We're looking forward to another year of adoptions to come üêà
