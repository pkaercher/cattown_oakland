As followers of Cat Town know, the Cat Zone is where our free roaming cats wait for their future families. What some don't know is that we also have a Cat Zone 2, where specially trained volunteers work with cats, like Lowell, Finn, and Frank here, before they go up for adoption in a foster home or in the Cat Zone. If you're interested in becoming a Cat Zone 2 volunteer, please visit www.cattownoakland.org/get-involved#volunteer 🐈
