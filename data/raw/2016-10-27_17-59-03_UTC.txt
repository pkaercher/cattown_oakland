Talulah is so ready to find her family! This lovely 8 year old girl is very even tempered and polite - her foster mom writes, “Instead of meowing or walking on my head in the morning when she's hungry, I will open my eyes to see Talulah sitting on the covers, unmoving, and staring at me, like she just used her willpower to wake me up.” Talulah's only request is that she be a solo kitty in your home so she can be the center of your attention. Ready to add Talulah to your family? Reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting today, and be sure to check out her full bio at www.cattownoakland.org/talulah 🐈
