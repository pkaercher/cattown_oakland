Photo of the week goes to Elliot and Elwood's adopter. The pair only went home this past weekend, but we're very happy to see them already settling into their new home. If you've adopted a Cat Town cat, be sure to tag @cattownoak or #cattownoak in your photos so we can follow along in their journey!
