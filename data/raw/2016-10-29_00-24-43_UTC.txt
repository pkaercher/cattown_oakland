Happy #FosterFriday, everyone! Bonded pair, Marlo (gray & white) and Tyler are ready to find the loving home they deserve. Tyler, the more confident of the two, loves to chit chat and watch birds from the window. And Marlo, though more reserved, will curl up in your lap for cuddles and pets. Learn more about these two on our website at www.cattownoakland.org/tyler-and-marlo, and be sure to reach out to info@cattownoakland.org if interested in adopting 🐈
