Cat Zone favorite, Walter, is in need of a TEMPORARY FOSTER - about 2 months - where he can heal from a skin condition. He'll need a small, clean space, so If you have a bathroom to spare, this lovable boy would be so grateful. Please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org for foster inquiries, and please share! 🐈
