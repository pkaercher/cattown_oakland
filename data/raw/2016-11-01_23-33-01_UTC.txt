Adoption updates! From top left, foster kittens Penny and Humphry went home after only 10 days in foster, Cat Zone cats Lovejoy and Irving found homes after one week in the Cat Zone, and senior girl, Bailey, went home with someone looking for a sweet and cuddly lap cat - essentially Bailey in a nutshell! Thank you to all who have been spreading the word about Cat Town, you're helping these cats find the loving homes they deserve.
