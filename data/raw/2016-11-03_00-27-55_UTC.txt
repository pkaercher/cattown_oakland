Senior cat, Twiggy, is looking for a family with whom she can spend her time curled up on the couch and betting her toys back and forth. She's on the shyer side to start, but once she's comfortable in her new home, you'll be her very best friend. If you're ready to make Twiggy the newest member of your family, be sure to reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting. And be sure to check out her full bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/twiggy 🐈
