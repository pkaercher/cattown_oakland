Senior cat, Maisy, is looking for a sweet family who can give her all the belly rubs she craves. Though this fluffy lady is shy at first, once she's warmed up be prepared to spend lots of time curled up on the couch together. Potential adopters will need to keep her on a special diet, but she'll be sure to thank you with lots of love. Reach out to info@cattownoakland.org for adoption inquiries, and check out Maisy's full bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/Maisy üêà
