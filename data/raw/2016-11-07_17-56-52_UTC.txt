Behind the scenes at Cat Town on a closed day - After unpacking some supplies in the Cat Zone, we turned some packing paper into a (supervised) toy. Needless to say, the cats had a ball! Come get some playtime of your own when we open our Cafe doors at 9:30AM on Wednesday morning. Be sure to make a reservation-donation online to secure your entry 🐈
