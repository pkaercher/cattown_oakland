One year olds, Georgia and Baldwin, are always curious about what's going on around them, and are huge fans of play. These two love other cats and would do well in a home with another confident feline to show them the ropes. A patient, understanding adopter would be the perfect companion to these two, to help them continue building their confidence. If you're the person this bonded pair has been looking for, reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
