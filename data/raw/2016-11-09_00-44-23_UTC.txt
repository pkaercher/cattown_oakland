Hank is feeling overwhelmed by all this election talk and has checked out for the day. But he'll be up and ready to greet visitors tomorrow morning when we open the Cat Zone at 10AM. Maybe he, and his bonded partner, Brodie, will even find their new family! Stop into the Cafe as early as 9:30 and grab a coffee before heading in to meet all our adoptable cats 🐈
