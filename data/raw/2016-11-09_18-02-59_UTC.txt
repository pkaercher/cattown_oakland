At the end of a long and contentious election season, we can all use some cat therapy, so we'll be waiving entry fees into the Cat Zone for the day. Finding shelter cats the loving homes they deserve is a cause we can all agree on. Come spend the day with our cats and your fellow cat people at 2869 Broadway from 10AM to 7PM 🐈
