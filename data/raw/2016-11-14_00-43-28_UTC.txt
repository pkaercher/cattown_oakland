Bonded buddies, Finn (left) and Frank are finding their way in the Cat Zone. They're still on the shyer side, but love to play. We're open until 7PM today at 2869 Broadway, so come by, grab a wand toy, and help these two continue to grow. You can also make an impact by making a donation, which will be doubled thanks to a generous $60,000 matching grant. Visit www.cattownoakland.org/donate to learn more and make a donation 🐈
