Making a contribution to Cat Town changes lives for Oakland's at-risk shelter cats. With your support we can give senior, ill, and passed over shelter cats, the care and support they need outside the shelter cage. And if you donate now, your contribution will be DOUBLED thanks to a generous matching grant of $60,000. Visit www.cattownoakland.org/donate to make a contribution 🐈
