It's hard not to fall in love with handsome 6 year old Francis. When you get home from a long day, he'll be sure to greet you at the door with a friendly hello before getting started on some quality play time. Then, when it's time to settle down, he'll cuddle right up on your chest and nuzzle into your neck. If you're ready to make this affectionate, playful boy a part of your family, reach out to info@cattownoakland.org, and see his full bio and more photos at www.cattownoakland.org/francis üêà
