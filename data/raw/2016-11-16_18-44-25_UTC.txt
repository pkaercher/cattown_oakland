Cosmo's foster mom can't say enough about this beautiful boy. He tends to be a little hesitant when meeting new people, but once he's settled in, get ready to watch him roll over while he soaks up the cheek scratches. He's made great strides outside the shelter cage, and hopes to find a family that will continue to indulge him in pets and play, while he continues to grow his confidence.
