#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Patrick (B&W) and Joy were two of our long term foster cats. They we're very under socialized when we first met them, but found confidence in their foster home, and in each other. Now they're continuing to build that confidence with their new family. Their adopter tells us that Patrick is a total snuggle monster, always rolling over for belly rubs, and Joy can't get enough playtime, especially with her laser pointer. They're still finding their footing in their new home, but they continue to make great progress 🐈
