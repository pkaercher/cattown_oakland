Sweet Talulah is looking for a new foster home. She is an absolute sweetheart and will be sure to thank you by keeping you entertained on a daily basis. She's looking for a space where she can be a solo kitty, and while older teens might be ok, she's most comfortable in the company of adults. If you or someone you know is able to foster her, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org, and please share if you can 🐈
