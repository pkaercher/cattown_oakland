We're coming up on the gift giving season, but did you know that you can make a donation to Cat Town as a gift for the cat lover in your life? You can choose from 8 stories of cats we've helped, like Howie here, and we'll send that story to the recipient of your choosing. Plus, your donation will be DOUBLED thanks to a generous matching grant of $60,000. Visit www.cattownoakland.org/donate to turn your contribution into a gift and help Oakland's at-risk shelter cats find the loving homes they deserve üêà
