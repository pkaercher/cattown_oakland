Happy #FosterFriday! Sweet Axel is the latest muse in our ongoing foster art show at the Cat Town Cafe. All pieces have been donated by the artist and will go home with the cat when they're adopted. Axel is an old soul looking for a calm environment where he can spend quality time with his family. While he is shy around new people, once he's comfortable in his new home, he'll be full of love and affection. Because of his deformed front paw he will need to be an indoor only cat, but that just mean more cuddle time for you! Reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting, and check out his full bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/axel üêà
