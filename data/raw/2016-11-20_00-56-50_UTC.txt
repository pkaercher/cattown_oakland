Bonded brothers, Lewis and Hathaway, are looking for a short term foster home. These two are energetic, so they should go to a home where they can get lots of playtime. Lewis is the shyer of the two, but both enjoy pets and they're even good with other cats. If you've got a space to be a two week long foster, reach out to info@cattownoakland.org üêà
