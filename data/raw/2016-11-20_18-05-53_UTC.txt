Amazon is already handing out deep discounts, and if your planning to do any of your holiday shopping online, you can help Oakland's needy cats in the process. Visit smile.amazon.com and sign into your Amazon account. Make us your selected charity, and Amazon will donate 0.5% of your purchase to Cat Town. It's a super simple way to give back while shopping this holiday season. And if you'd like to help us with physical goods, you can check out our Amazon wish list - http://amzn.to/2gqHhOJ - full of items we use to care for our foster and Cafe cats. Thank you for making Cat Town part of your gift giving this holiday season üêà
