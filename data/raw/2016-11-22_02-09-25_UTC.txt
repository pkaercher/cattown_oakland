Bonded buddies, Hank (orange tabby) and Brodie, got in some sun bathing this afternoon while we cleaned the Cat Zone. We're closed again tomorrow, but if you're interested in adopting these two, be sure to send an email to info@cattownoakland.org, and we hope to see you at the Cafe on Wednesday morning 🐈
