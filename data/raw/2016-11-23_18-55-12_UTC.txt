#WhereAreTheNowWednesday: Bastet was a tricky cat when she arrived at the shelter, leaning into her cage door for pets, but swatting when someone came close. We guessed she was stressed by the space, so we brought her to Cat Town, where we also learned that she enjoyed the company of other cats. Now she spends her days with her new family (including another Cat Town alum, Spencer). Her adopter recently wrote "[Bastet] doesn't like to be away from me and happily greets me every time I walk in the front door. She is super talkative and makes a sound every time she jumps up onto or down from something, which is cute...She's wonderful!" We're glad to hear that Bastet continues to love life outside the shelter cage! What to help us keep helping cats like Bastet?
