Just a reminder that adoption fees will be waived this Friday through Monday (11/25 - 11/28) thanks to @zappos and @bestfriendsanimalsociety's "Home for the Pawlidayz" event. Visit www.zappos.com/pets to find a participating organization near you, and if you're in the Bay Area come pay us a visit in Oakland and take home a new friend. See all our adoptable cats online at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt 🐈
