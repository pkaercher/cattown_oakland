November is #AdoptASeniorPetMonth, and with adoption fees waived through Monday, what better time to take home a loving companion, like Jamie. She's very sweet, but has had a tough life, and is looking for a gentle, understanding family to take her home. She enjoys the company of other cats and her vet bills will be covered by Cat Town for the rest of her life! If you can't adopt, but would like to foster, we'd love to find her a gentle home ASAP, even if it's temporary. Please share with your friends and family, and if you can foster, or are interested in adopting, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org üêà
