#SeniorCatSaturday continues with Madison! This lovely lady is a total purr machine and loves pets. She takes meds for her hypothyroid, and will need a somewhat experienced adopter, but she is an all around total sweetheart. Celebrate #AdoptASeniorPetMonth by taking Madison home. Reach out to info@cattownoakland.org for details on adopting 🐈
