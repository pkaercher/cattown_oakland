The Zappos.com "Home for the Pawlidayz" event is ongoing through tomorrow, and that means there is no better time to adopt a new pet. It's also #AdoptASeniorPetMonth, which makes it the perfect time to take home a senior companion looking for a loving home. You can see all our current senior cats by visiting http://www.cattownoakland.org/senior-cats, and send any adoption inquiries to info@cattownoakland.org üêà
