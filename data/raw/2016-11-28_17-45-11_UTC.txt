While you're shopping for deals this Cyber Monday, remember to make Cat Town your @amazonsmile charity and have .5% of your purchase total go to helping Oakland's at-risk shelter cats. You can also make a donation from our Amazon wish list, complete with items we need to care for our Cafe and foster cats. Check it out at http://amzn.to/2gqHhOJ, and HUGE thank you to those who have recently donated! 🐈
