Cybell is a spunky 4-5 month old kitten up for adoption through our foster program. Her foster mom says she provides endless entertainment for herself, and her feline and human friends. And at the end of the day, a cozy lap is her favorite place to land for some one-on-one time with her human. Check out her full bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/cybell and drop a line to info@cattownoakland.org to inquire about adopting 🐈
