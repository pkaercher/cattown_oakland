What does it mean to give to Cat Town? It means giving a senior cat a chance at finding somewhere to spend the golden years in comfort; it means giving life-saving surgery to an injured cat; it means keeping a bonded pair together and finding them a home together; it means helping under socialized cats learn that positive human relationships are not only possible, but enjoyable; it means helping a cat escape the chaos of the shelter cage. This #GivingTuesday, we hope you'll consider making a donation to Cat Town and help us keep finding loving homes for Oakland's at-risk shelter cats. Plus, your donation will help us earn a $60,000 matching grant, doubling the impact of your contribution.
