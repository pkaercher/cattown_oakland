Chance is on the hunt for a temporary or permanent home. While his feline leukemia  requires he be a solo, indoor only cat, Chance doesn't let his condition define him, and will be nothing but a ball of love and happy energy in your home. His favorite place to land is in a lap, soaking up pets with his legs up in the air. Can you foster for Chance? Or maybe you're interested in making him a permanent fixture in your life? Either way, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org with any foster or adoption inquiries, and read Chance's bio on our website at www.cattownoakland.org/chance üêà
