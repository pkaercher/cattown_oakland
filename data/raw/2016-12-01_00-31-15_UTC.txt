#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Homer and Maggie were in their foster home for a few months before their family realized they couldn't let them do. We call that a #FosterFail (which is a good thing!) Homer, the father in the duo, loves soaking up pets, and following his humans around the house. His daughter, Maggie, is an avid lover of laps and can be heard purring from many feet away during cuddle time. And when it's time to play, these two go crazy for their favorite wand toys. We love hearing about Cat Town alum, so if you've adopted with us, be sure to tag #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday so we can pass along the updates! üêà
