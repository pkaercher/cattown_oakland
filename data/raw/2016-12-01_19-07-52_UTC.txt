Have you been introduced to Meeka? This sweet senior lady is a total welcome wagon, greeting guests at the door upon arrival. While she likes to take a little time to scope out her surroundings, once she's comfortable she'll be curling up in your lap on a regular basis. She is looking for an adopter with previous cat experience to help care for her kidney disease. Maybe you're the one Meeka's been waiting for? If so reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting, and check out more photos and info online at www.cattownoakland.org/meeka üêà
