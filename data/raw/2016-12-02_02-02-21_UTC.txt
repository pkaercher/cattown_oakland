Puck is a fairly recent addition to the Cat Zone. He's a cat who isn't ready for pets and tends to swat when hands come near, but he's a HUGE fan of play with the wand toys. Play is another great way for under socialized cats to build positive relationships with humans. Come help Puck continue to grow and visit us at Cat Town when we open tomorrow morning at 9:30AM at 2869 Broadway 🐈
