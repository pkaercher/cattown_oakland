Attention potential fosters! We've got three sweet cats at the shelter looking for temporary homes. Marty is goofy and playful boy looking for an experienced foster. Winnie is a sweetheart, but is stressed out by the shelter environment. And Allie is looking for a quiet home where she can decompress. All three cats are looking for small, calm spaces to start, so if you have a spare bathroom, office, or bedroom, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org, and share amongst your family and friends üêà
