We're on our way to securing a $60,000 matching grant and you can help us get there! A donation of any amount will DOUBLE in size - $25 becomes $50, $50 becomes $100, and $500 becomes $1000. That means we can save twice as many at-risk shelter cats. Please visit www.cattownoakland.org/donate to learn about the ways you can give and make a contribution to our rescue efforts 🐈
