Happy #NationalKittenDay! At Cat Town, we're especially dedicated to helping under socialized tween kittens - what we call Forgotten Kittens - become socialized. Our specially trained volunteers work with them before they make their way in to the Cat Zone. Some of our current Forgotten Kittens include Judith, Frank, Jim, Eva, and Huck, pictured here clock wise. If you're interested in learning how to help with our Forgotten Kitten Project, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
