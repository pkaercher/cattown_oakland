As some of our followers may have heard, our partners at @feralchange are losing their space at American Steel Studios in West Oakland in the coming month. They have close to 30 cats needing to be rehomed, either with fosters or permanent adopters. Because of the work they do, many of their cats will need homes with patient, understanding guardians. Please spread the word amongst your networks and direct any inquiries to sarah@feralchange.org. You can learn more about the incredible work being done at www.feralchange.org 🐈
