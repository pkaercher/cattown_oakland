Cat Town began with volunteers from the Oakland Animal Shelter, a place where Oakland's community members come together for a cause they believe in. Since then, we have come to know so many bright lights in the Oakland community, known for their passion and creativity.

This is not uncommon within Oakland - a place so full of people with heart and talent and unique personalities - and it's what makes it such a special place; a place we are so proud to call home. 
The lives lost in Friday's tragedy were no different, and for that reason, this loss is all that much harder to process. But our hearts are with the families and friends of the victims, and we know Oakland will hold you up in this time of need by all means necessary.
