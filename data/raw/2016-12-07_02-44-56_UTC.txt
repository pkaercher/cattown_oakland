Last week's adoptions! From top left, clockwise: Mickey, Banana, Finn & Frank, Tanis, Lowell, Talulah, and Samson. We are especially excited for Talulah and Samson, who have been foster cats for a good while. Want to adopt? Check out all of our available cats online at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt 🐈
