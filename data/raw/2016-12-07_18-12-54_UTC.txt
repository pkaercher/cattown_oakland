Senior lady, Jada, is super sweet and ready to find her home. This lady might take a little time getting used to new people and spaces, but once she's comfortable, she'll be demanding rubs left and right. Her foster says she even enjoys being held, which is very helpful when administering her daily medication. If you're looking for a truly lovable companion, then Jada is your girl.
