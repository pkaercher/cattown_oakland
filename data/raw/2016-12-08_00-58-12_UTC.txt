#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Macaroon and Ruby spent time in the Cat Zone late last fall, and were adopted almost exactly one year ago. We recently received a great update from their adopter: "I adopted Sophia and Sashimi (aka Macaroon and Ruby) almost a year ago on 12/1/15.  They are such a joy.  Their favorite pastimes are playing with strings and ribbons, looking out the window, and sleeping.  I'm so thankful everyday that I have them." If you've adopted a Cat Town cat (or two!), don't forget to tag #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday for a chance to be featured! üêà
