Tyler (black and white) & Marlo are looking for a foster or permanent home! Tyler is the more confident of the pair, and promises to provide plenty of entertainment while playing with his toys and watching birds from any available perch. Marlo loves play too, and tends to be a bit more cuddly, snuggling up on the couch with you at the end of the day. A calm home for this adult bonded pair would suit them best. If you can foster or adopt these two, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org, and learn more about the duo online at www.cattownoakland.org/tyler-and-marlo 🐈
