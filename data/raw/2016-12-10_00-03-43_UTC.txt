We're looking to find temporary or permanent homes for these two sweethearts before the holidays get going. Chance (left) is a playful, affectionate 8 month old kitten looking to be a solo indoor cat due to his feline leukemia. Grady is a super lovable companion, who will ask for endless cuddles. He too needs to be an indoor only, solo cat due to his FIV+ status and dislike of other cats. If you can be a foster to either of these boys, or are interested in adopting one of them, please send a message to info@cattownoakland.org ASAP, and please share if you can 🐈
