It's the weekend and that means we're celebrating #SeniorCatSaturday. Nancy, a dignified senior lady herself, believes that age is just a number. While pets and lap time are at the top of her list of favorite things, she hasn't counted out the importance of play, and lets her inner jungle cat run wild as soon as the ribbon toy shows up. She's also got the cutest, raspy, blue singer voice we've ever heard. Maybe she'll sing you a tune if you bring her home! Shoot us an email at info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting and read more about Nancy at www.cattownoakland.org/nancy 🐈
