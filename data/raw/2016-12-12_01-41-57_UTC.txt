Looking for a lovable companion? How about one who loves belly rubs? Well then, foster cat Jenkins is your guy! While he takes a little time getting used to his surroundings, he will be nothing but love once he's comfortable, and he hopes to go to a calm, kid free home. Reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to inquire about adopting!
