Cats with physical deformities, like Axel here, can have a hard time getting out of the shelter. That's why we knew we had to give him the second chance he deserved. Now in a Cat Town foster home, Axel continues to prove that he is a lovable companion. We're able to help cats like Axel make their way out of the shelter thanks to donations like yours. Please consider donating to our fundraiser which will be doubled thanks to a generous $60,000 matching grant! Visit www.cattownoakland.org/donate to make a contribution üêà
