#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Mia came to Cat Town in need of eye surgery. While recovering, she came down with a skin condition and spent a few months in foster care healing before being adopted by a loving family! They recently sent us this update: "I just wanted to let you know Mia is still doing well and becoming more comfortable here every day. Even she and our other cat Santi are getting along...[Mia] runs back and forth throughout the house chasing toys or sometimes chasing nothing at all. Santi tries to keep up but he can't even come close. We're loving Mia and so happy to have her as part of our family." We love to hear updates on Cat Town alum!
