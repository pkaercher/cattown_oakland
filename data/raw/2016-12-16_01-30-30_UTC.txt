It's been a very rainy day here in Oakland, and the weather has left the cats in serious need of cuddles. Come finish out this dreary day in the company of our cozy cats - our doors are open until 7PM at 2869 Broadway. And if you can't make it by and still want to make a difference in the lives of our rescue cats, you can make a donation by visiting www.cattownoakland.org/donate 🐈
