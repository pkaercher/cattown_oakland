There is just one more hour in our TRIPLE fundraising match, but we are already floored by the generosity of our supporters in the past 24 hours. With these funds we'll be able to get more cats like Jamie out of the shelter into safe, comfortable spaces. Your support is truly the backbone of our organization and we can't thank you enough. If you haven't had the chance yet and would still like to donate, please visit www.cattownoakland.org/donate 🐈
