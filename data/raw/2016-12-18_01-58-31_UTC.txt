This #SeniorCatSaturday, we're working to find Sultan a new home. This 13 year old foster is the king of cuddles, and loves being near his people. As if that weren't cute enough, just take a moment to appreciate his big green eyes and adorable underbite, and you're sure to fall in love over and over again. Sultan will be looking right back at you with the same feeling! Reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting, and learn more about Sultan by visiting www.cattownoakland.org/sultan 🐈
