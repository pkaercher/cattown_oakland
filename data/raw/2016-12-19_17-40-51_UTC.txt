Winnie is sill in need of a foster home. She's very sweet, but is having a hard time with all the shelter stress, and would love to move to a calm foster home. Somewhere with a small space, like an office or bathroom, where she can acclimate would be ideal. If you can care for Winnie while she builds her confidence, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to inquire about fostering 🐈
