We saw a truly incredible outpouring of support during our triple match challenge at the end of last week, and cannot thank all of our generous donors enough for moving us so far forward toward our $60,000 goal. If you were hoping to donate, there's still time double your impact before the end of 2016, and a great way to do so is by turning your contribution into a gift. You'll get to choose a cat story, like Sunday's here, to have sent to your recipient to show them the kind of impact your donation will make. Visit www.cattownoakland.org/donate and give a gift that gives back.
