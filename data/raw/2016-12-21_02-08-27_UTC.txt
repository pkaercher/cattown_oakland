These cats are heading home for the holidays! This weeks adoption include (from left to right) Icarus (with his new dad), Vivian, Giorgio Washington, Jacqueline, bonded pair Kiki & Dizzey, and the kid that never quit, Chance. After two surgeries, a case of ringworm, and being diagnosed with feline leukemia, this tween kitten never lost his spunk, and now he's found his new family! Congrats to all!
