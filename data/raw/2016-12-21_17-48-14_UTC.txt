Miss independent, Ellie, is looking for a calm home to call her own. This 2-year-old lady is happiest enjoying the comfort of a sunbeam, but will seek out pets, play, and especially treats when she's in the mood. Her future adopter should have cat experience and should be able to provide her with a calm, relaxed space. You can read more about Ellie on our website at www.cattownoakland.org/ellie and reach out to info@cattownoakland.org with any questions about adoption 🐈
