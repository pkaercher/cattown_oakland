#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: When Patrick and Joy were in a Cat Town foster home, we gave them lots of time to build their confidence. Now they're enjoying their new home after being adopted this past fall. One of their old foster parents is caring for them while their adopters are out of town, and tells us that, "Joy comes up for pets and doesn't flinch when you pet her [like she used to]. And Patrick will let you put your head on his side/tummy! They both come to you to be petted while you're standing, and Patrick stays put, lying down and doesn't seem to care when you go to move past him or get up!" These two are a great example of What patience can do for under socialized cats. Huge thanks to their fosters and adopters for seeing their potential. If you'd like to foster with Cat Town, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org üêà
