Reed is all about the ribbon toys this afternoon. Maybe you can give him and his brother, Rowan, a new home for the holidays! We'll be open today and tomorrow until 7PM, but close at 3PM on Christmas Eve (Saturday), and will be closed on Christmas day (Sunday). We hope you'll come by for some quality cat time in the next couple days. Make a Cat Zone reservation-donation online at www.cattowncafe.org üêà
