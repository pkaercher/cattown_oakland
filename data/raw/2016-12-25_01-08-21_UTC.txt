How adorable is Axel?! This 4-year-old boy is still looking for his future family. Since Axel has a deformed front paw, he will need to be an indoor only cat, and would love to go to a relaxed home where he can take some time to get used to his new people and surroundings. But as you can see, once he's comfortable, he'll melt in your hands any time pets are available. Maybe Axel will ring in the new year in your home!
