With much of the US experiencing freezing cold  temperatures, Hector wants to remind everyone to pack a pair of gloves when you head out for the holidays. We'll be closed today, tomorrow, and Tuesday, but hope everyone who's celebrating enjoys time with family and friends, be they feline or human! Come see us when we reopen our doors on Wednesday morning at 9:30AM at 2869 Broadway 🐈
