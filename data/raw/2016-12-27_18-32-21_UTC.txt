Inspired by our previous triple match challenge, an anonymous donor has agreed to match up to $1000 for the next 24 hours! That means your contribution will be TRIPLED, thanks to this and our other $60,000 matching grant. We are more than 90% of the way to reaching our goal! Help us rescue even more needy cats in the year to come! Visit www.cattownoakland.org/donate to make a contribution. But don't delay, this match only lasts until 10AM PST tomorrow morning (12/28)! üêà
