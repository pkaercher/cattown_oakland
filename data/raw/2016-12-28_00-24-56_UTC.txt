Sweet 4-year-old Reina is a total lap cat. Her foster says her favorite place to be is on or near her people. She does prefer being a solo cat and any future adopters should have prior cat experience. If you have room in your home and heart, make this lovable lady your newest companion by reaching out to info@cattownoakland.org. Can't adopt but want to make a difference? Visit www.cattownoakland.org/donate and help us rescue even more needy shelter cats in the year to come 🐈
