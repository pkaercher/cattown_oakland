Just one more hour until our $1000 match challenge is over! If you're still hoping to make a contribution, please visit www.cattownoakland.org/donate, and help us find more loving homes for senior cats like Bailey. When we met Bailey at the shelter, she had a number of health concerns, and with the help of the Friends of Oakland Animal Services, she was able to get the care she needed before going to a foster home and eventually being adopted! Thank you for supporting our continued rescue efforts! üêà
