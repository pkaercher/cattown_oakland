When you donate to Cat Town, you help bonded buddies, like Hank and Brodie, stay together and find a loving home as a pair. If you'd still like to make a contribution to our $60,000 fundraising goal, please visit www.cattownoakland.org/donate, and help us rescue more of Oakland's at-risk shelter cats in the year to come! 🐈
