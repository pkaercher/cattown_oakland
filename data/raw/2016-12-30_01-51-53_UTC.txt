When you donate to Cat Town, you help cats like brothers Kip and Kade, get out of the shelter and receive the medical care they need. These two spent just a short time recovering at Cat Town before being adopted by a loving family. Help us keep helping Oakland's at-risk shelter cats by donating at www.cattownoakland.org/donate and have your contribution DOUBLED through the end of the year thanks to a $60,000 matching grant! 🐈
