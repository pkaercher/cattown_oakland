We're looking to help 5 cats get out of the shelter and into foster homes. From the top left, clockwise, Charlotte, Mini, Buster, Carmen, and Darcy are all in need. What better way to start the new year than by giving a needy shelter cat a safe space to land before being adopted?! Reach out to info@cattownoakland.org with any foster inquiries
