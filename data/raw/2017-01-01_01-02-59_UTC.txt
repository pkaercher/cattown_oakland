It's the final day of the year and that means it's your final chance to double the impact of your donation! We've seen incredible support during our $60,000 matching grant challenge and can't thank our supporters enough for making it possible to get sick, senior, stressed, and under socialized cats out of the shelter and into comfortable spaces. 
You make all our work possible. We're looking forward to big things in the year to come! 🐈
