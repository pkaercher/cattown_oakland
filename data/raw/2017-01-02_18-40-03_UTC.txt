Are you looking for a sweet, playful, goofy cat to complete your family? Well let us introduce you to foster cat, Billy! If you can give him a little time to get used to his surroundings, you'll soon find him bringing you toys and snuggling up for pets. And when he's feeling more pensive, you'll likely find him staring out the window, enjoying some time watching birds. Billy is a very sweet, playful guy who will be sure to keep you entertained.
