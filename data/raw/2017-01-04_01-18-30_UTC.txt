Emmett (white fur) and Fletcher are two bonded buddies looking for a relaxed home to call their own. These two lovable guys are sure to provide lots of love between the two of them. Emmett tends to be the cuddlier one, while Fletcher is happy entertaining with some independent play, until he's decided to get in on some pets himself. If you think these two are the missing pieces to your family puzzle, send an email to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
