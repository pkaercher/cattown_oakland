To all our Cat Town patrons, we are thrilled to announce our ever growing partnership with RAWR (@eatlikealion), an Oakland-based cat company, to bring you the RAWR Coffee Bar at Cat Town. 
While we make this exciting transition, the Cafe space will be closed for renovations through the month of January. There won't be any snacks or beverages available for purchase during that time, but we encourage you to bring your own. We ask that visitors arrive 5-10 minutes prior to their appointment time
We're very excited about this upcoming collaboration and appreciate your understanding while we make this transition. Thank you, for supporting our mission and helping us continue to find homes for Oakland's neediest cats.
