#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: When we met Easton at the shelter, he was desperate for affection and a life outside the shelter cage. It's safe to say, based on the recent photo and update his new family sent along, that he got exactly what he was looking for. 
His adopters write, "My son is totally smitten with [Easton] and has taken more responsibility to feed him most mornings and evenings. He is the most mellow cat!...Thanks to Cat Town for bringing Easton to us!" There is nothing better than a happy ending! Be sure to tag your photos with #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday if you post any updates about your Cat Town alum! üêà
