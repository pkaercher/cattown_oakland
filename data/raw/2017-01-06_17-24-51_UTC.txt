We're looking to find foster families for a couple of our Cat Town cats. Bubbles is a little hesitant at first, but tends to melt into pets after the introduction period. Carrie is a sweet, but stressed girl, who needs a quiet home where she can decompress. Both cats are in need of a small space (bathroom, office, etc.) to start. Please share with family and friends, and be sure to reach out to info@cattownoakland.org if you're able to foster or adopt 🐈
