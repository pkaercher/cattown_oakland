Zoe's been waiting for the right adopter to come along and give her the gentle home she needs. Anyone who's followed Zoe's story knows she's had some bad luck in the past, but more recently she's been making major strides in her Cat Town foster home. Her foster mom recently told us that, where Zoe was once utterly skittish and reclusive, she now sits out in the open, more comfortable in her surroundings. She also enjoys the company of other cats, so a calm, quiet home with a feline companion would be great!
