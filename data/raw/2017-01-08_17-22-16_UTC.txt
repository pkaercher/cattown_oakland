Sometimes, fosters send along such perfect descriptions of the cats in their care, there is nothing extra for us to say. For example, Poppy's foster mom writes, "[Poppy] loves pets and affection and loves being the center of attention. She purrs up a storm and when she's really happy, starts making air biscuits. Every night, she sleeps near the foot of the bed next to me and every morning, plops herself on my chest while I'm in bed and gives me a kitty smile." We couldn't say it better if we tried!
