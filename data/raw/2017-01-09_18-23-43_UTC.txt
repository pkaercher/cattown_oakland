Trevor had totally transformed in the care of his foster mom. When he first arrived at Cat Town, he'd had little human contact. Now he curls up on the couch, demanding belly rubs! He is a true testament to what time and patience can do for a needy shelter cat. Trevor is still looking for his future family, and would love to go to a home where he can have his people all to himself. If you're ready to add this lovable boy to your team, reach out to info@cattownoakland.org, and read more about him at www.cattownoakland.org/trevor 🐈
