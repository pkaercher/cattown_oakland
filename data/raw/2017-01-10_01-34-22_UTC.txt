It's been a day full of Cat Zone hide-and-seek for Judith! She and her sister, Eva, are two playful teen kittens looking for the family of their dreams. Reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up an adoption meeting, or make a Cat Zone reservation at www.bookeo.com\cattown to visit these two when we re-open on Wednesday at noon 🐈
