#TongueOutTuesday is Paisley’s favorite day of the week. This active, 1-year-old tabby is up for adoption through our foster program. Going to a home where she can spend time playing with another cat would make her a very happy lady. Just give her a little time to adjust to her new surroundings, and soon she’ll be greeting you at the door, ready to pounce on playtime. You can set up a time to meet Paisley by emailing info@cattownoakland.org, and be sure to visit www.cattownoakland.org/paisley to learn more about her 🐈
