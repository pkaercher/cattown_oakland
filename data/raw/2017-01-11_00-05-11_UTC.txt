More families came together this week at Cat Town! From top left: Huck (with one of his adopters) & Jim, Elise, Grady, Alaska, Puck (who is sharing a home with Cat Town alum, Lowell), and bonded buddies, Oreo & Felix. What a great way to start off 2017! Be sure to tag photos of your Cat Town cats with #cattownalum so we can stay up to date on their adventures! 🐈
