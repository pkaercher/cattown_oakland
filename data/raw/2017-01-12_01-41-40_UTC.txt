#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Sanchi was pretty stressed when we met her at the shelter. But once she got into a foster home, she began to blossom, and continues to do so with her new family. They write, "Sanchi is doing great! … She loves to cuddle and anytime we are sitting down she wants to come say hi. She loves to sleep with us in the bed, usually at the foot or right in between us. She also knows how to hangout by herself at the big windows in our apartment. …  She is still a little skittish but, she rarely hides under the bed, and she isn't spooked when we come in the door anymore … She's been amazing to have around, and she fills the house with love and presence.” Sounds like a happy ending to us! 🐈
