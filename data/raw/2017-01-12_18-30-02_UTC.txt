With fluff like Solomon’s, it can be hard to see where the fur starts and the feather toy ends! This senior foster cat comes equipped with his own winter coat, and is looking for a cat savvy adopter to spoil him with with playtime and treats. And when he’s finished attacking his prey (feather toy), he’ll reveal his sensitive side and curl up next to you in bed or on the couch. If this master of fluff is the cat you’ve been missing in your life, reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
