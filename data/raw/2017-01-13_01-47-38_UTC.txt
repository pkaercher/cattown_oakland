Based on how much he likes water, you might think Hathaway was a fish, and not a cat. If there’s water around - the remnants of a mop, a running sink, a bowl of water - he’s into it! This playful teen kitten is still up for adoption with his brother, Lewis. Come meet them and our 16 other adoptable cats at 2863 Broadway today until 7PM 🐈
