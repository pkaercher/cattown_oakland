Foster cat, Nellie, is kicking off 2017 with a resolution to shed a few pounds and find a loving family to help her do it! She's turned to the ever popular method of laser pointer chasing, with a side of shoelace chasing, to boost her exercise regiment. When she's finished her workout, Nellie likes to spend time curled up with her people on the couch. She is looking to be a solo cat, and hopes you'll be patient with her while she adjusts to her new surroundings, but this even-tempered lady is more than ready to join your family!
