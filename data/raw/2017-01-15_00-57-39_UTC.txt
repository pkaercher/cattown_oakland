Our Foster Coordinator recently paid a visit to 3-year-old foster cat, Archie, and says he's doing so incredibly well! He has made HUGE progress in his foster home. Archie used to have a habit of nipping when someone got down on the floor to pet him, but not if they were standing over him, which is a fairly uncommon tendency in cats. But with lots of time, patience, and dedication from his foster and, this little guy is now comfortable and confident getting love and affection any which way he can! If you're interested in adopting Archie, reach out to info@cattownoakland.org, and reach his bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/archie üêà
