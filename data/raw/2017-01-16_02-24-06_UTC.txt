Happy #SeniorCatSunday! Senior cats make amazing companions, but often have trouble being adopted from the shelter. That's why Cat Town is dedicated to giving seniors, like Jada, a place outside the shelter to show off their personalities. Jada is very laid-back, and warms up to new people quickly. Give her a warm lap to snuggle up in and she'll show her appreciation by always greeting you at the door when you get home. Adopters will need to give her daily medicine, but her relaxed demeanor makes it barely a task at all. Visit www.cattownoakland.org/jada to learn more about her, and drop a line to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a time to meet üêà
