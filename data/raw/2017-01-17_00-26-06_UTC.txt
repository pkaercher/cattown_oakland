Sweet Zephyr is still looking for his new family. This handsome guy is a fan of play and likes to spend time near his people. But don't be fooled into thinking he's clingy, he's just as happy being independent and exploring on his own. Zephyr would make a great pet for first time cat owners, but does prefer to be a solo cat. What are you waiting for?! Make an appointment to meet Zephyr in his foster home by emailing info@cattownoakland.org.
