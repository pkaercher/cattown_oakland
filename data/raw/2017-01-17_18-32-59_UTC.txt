Congrats to all the new families who came together this week at Cat Town! Clockwise from top left: Luna, Francis, Tina, Harrison, and Poppy all went to their new homes. Visit www.cattownoakland.org/adopt to see all our available cats, and reach out to info@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in bringing home a new best friend! 🐈
