FOSTER OR ADOPTER NEEDED for lovable senior, Nancy. This ageless beauty loves curling up on the couch and telling you about her day while soaking up pets.

Nancy would like to be in a home where she can be the only feline companion in a mellow environment. If you're able to foster, or would like to adopt this undeniably adorable senior lady, email info@cattownoakland.org, and be sure to share with family and friends üêà
