Beautiful foster cat, Chloe, is looking for a fun loving family who will match her energetic spirit. This 2-year-old girl loves to play, and pets are an absolute must, though she likes to call the shots on just how many she gets. She's sure to keep her people near by and is more than ready to lead the welcome committee when guests stop by. You can read more about Chloe by visiting www.cattownoakland.org/Chloe. If this beauty is destined to join your family, be sure to reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
