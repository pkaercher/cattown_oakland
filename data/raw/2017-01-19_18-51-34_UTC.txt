We currently have 6 black cats, and 6 tuxedo cats in the Cat Zone (out of 20 adoptable cats total!). Black cats can get a bad reputation, but we're here to dispel those nasty rumors! Black cats, like Hathaway here, make fantastic companions, just like any breed of cat can! Come meet all out adoptable cats today from noon to 7PM at 2863 Broadway, and bring home the family member you've been missing! 🐈
