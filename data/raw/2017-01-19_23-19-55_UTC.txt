2017 is shaping up to be a big year at Cat Town! 
We‚Äôre so excited to announce that, thanks to an incredibly generous grant from @maddiesfund, we‚Äôre breaking ground on construction of a new adoption center for the hardest-to-place cats! And to celebrate this exciting venture, all ADOPTION FEES will be WAIVED throughout construction for qualified adopters. 
The cafe and Cat Zone will be open and will operate normally during construction of the new space.

We‚Äôre looking to our Cat Town community to help us find FOSTERS, or even better, ADOPTERS, for 6 of our cats currently residing in the the space that will be undergoing construction. 
Please visit www.cattownoakland.org/cats-needing-foster to learn more about these cats and what kind of home they‚Äôre looking for. 
Email info@cattownoakland.org with any adoption or foster inquiries.
We can‚Äôt wait to help even more cats #ThanksToMaddie. If you or someone you know is interested, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org üêà
