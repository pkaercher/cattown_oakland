Miranda is a truly loyal companion looking for an equally loyal adopter. This 3-4-year-old lady loves to cuddle and be near her people, but values independence just as much. In her foster parent’s opinion, Miranda will likely adjust easily to a new home, as “Her initial shyness can turn quickly into an adorable loyalty." Sound like your kind of cat?
