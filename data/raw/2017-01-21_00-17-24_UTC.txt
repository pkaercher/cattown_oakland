Carrie is one of our under-socialized cats in our holding space at Cat Town. She spent a long time at the shelter and is now finding her way with humans, even learning to accept a few pets here and there. We think she'd do best in a home (temporary or permanent) with a patient, understanding caregiver to help her build her confidence. If you have a small space in your home (a bathroom, or a spare room), and you'd like to help this sweet girl build a positive relationship with humans, please email info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
