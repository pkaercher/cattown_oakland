We're still working to help some of our holding space cats find temporary or permanent homes before we break ground on construction next month; cats like bonded pair, Chili (tabby) and Pepper, who are sweet teen kittens looking to start off in a small space. These two are part of our forgotten kitten project, and have made lots of progress during their time at Cat Town. They're currently receiving treatment for a skin condition and are looking for someone with some cat experience to foster or adopt. Please send any inquiries to info@cattownoakland.org üêà
