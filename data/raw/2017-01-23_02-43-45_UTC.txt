What are two of the best ways to brighten your home - cats and art! Adeline is one of the cats who has inspired a piece of foster cat art, currently on display and Cat Town. The piece has been donated and will go home with her when she's adopted. Adeline is a sweet girl looking for a gentle home where she can play to her hearts content and collect pets just as often as she likes. Want to bring Adeline home with you? Email info@cattownoakland.org. Adoption fees are waived through the end of our adoption center construction for approved adopters🐈
