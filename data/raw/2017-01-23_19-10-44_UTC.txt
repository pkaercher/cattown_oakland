Li'l Dickie (left) and Gretchen are keeping warm in the Quiet Zone while we get things cleaned up in the Cat Zone. Both these guys are under socialized, but are learning to trust humans thanks to our staff, volunteers, and visitors like you. Make a reservation to visit all our Cat Zone cats in the coming week by visiting www.bookeo.com/cattown 🐈
