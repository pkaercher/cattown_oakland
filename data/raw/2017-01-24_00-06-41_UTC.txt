Sweet and playful girl, Aaliyah is currently in our holding space at Cat Town and looking for a foster or adopter. She's in the process of recovering from a skin condition, and needs a small, cleanable space to start in her new home. We're hoping to find her a space before we get started on our adoption center construction next month. If you're interested in fostering or adopting be sure to reach out to info@cattownoakland.org. All adoption fees are waived for qualified adopters through the end of construction üêà
