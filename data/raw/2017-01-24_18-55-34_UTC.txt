We had an incredible number of adoptions this past week! 6 of the cats who found homes were bonded pairs of forgotten kittens. From top left clockwise: Anna & Pharah, Eva & Judith, and Lewis & Hathaway, all went home with their new families. All six of these cats came to Cat Town after spending a long time at the shelter with little human interaction. But with our Forgotten Kitten Project, we're able to move teen kittens like these to Cat Town, where our specially trained volunteers can work with them to build confidence and trust with humans before being adopted. Congrats to all the new families 🐈
