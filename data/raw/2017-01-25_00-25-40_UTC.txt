6 more of the 12 Cat Town cats adopted this week: Memo (left), who started in the Cat Zone and moved to a foster home where he was able to relax and find his family; Cybell (top center), a 5-month old B&W kitten who came to the Cat Zone after spending 3 months in foster; Archie (top right), who had trouble with pets when he first arrived in foster, and is now eager for all kinds of affection; Zephyr (bottom center), who was overwhelmed by other cats in the Cat Zone, and ended up finding peace, and his family, in his foster home; And finally, Hector (B&W) and Mac, who each came to Cat Town as halves of other bonded pairs, but found companionship in one another, and are now headed to their new home together. Being able to move our cats between foster homes and our adoption center gives them the best chance to thrive and find the loving homes they deserve.
