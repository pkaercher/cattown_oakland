Mellow fellow, Axel, is looking for a calm home where he relax and soak up lots of affections. This old soul is looking for his perfect human companion, but might do ok with another mellow feline. He'll need to be an indoor cat because of his front right deformed paw, but don't think for a second that he lets it slow him down! Check out his full bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/Axel, and email info@cattownoakland.org with adoption inquiries.
