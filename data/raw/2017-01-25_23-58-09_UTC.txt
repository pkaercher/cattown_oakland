URGENT FOSTERS or ADOPTERS NEEDED! Chili, Pepper, and Aaliyah are all still in need of a 4-5 week foster home while we start construction on our adoption center. Once their treatment is complete, we'll bring them back to the Cat Zone. Each cat will need a small, cleanable space (e.g. a bathroom or office), and while Chili and Pepper can go to a temporary home together or separately, Aaliyah will need her own space. Our staff will also come to your home to provide supplies and treatment. Please email info@cattownoakland.org if you're able to foster, and be sure to share with family and friends üêà
