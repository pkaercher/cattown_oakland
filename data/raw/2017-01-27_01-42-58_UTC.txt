Lovable and fluffy are two words we use to describe foster cat Maisy, and are two things that inspired this recent portrait by @jacquj, now up in the Cat Town foster art show. Maisy is a real sweetheart and loves being near her people, though she will need a little time to adjust to her new surroundings. Just help her stay on top of her special diet, and she's sure to be your best friend in no time. And don't forget, if you adopt Maisy, you'll get a new companion and a new piece of art commemorating the occasion! What are you waiting for - email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a tome to meet Maisy üêà
