It's #FosterFriday and this week, we're helping Mini get into her new home! This fluffy lady is known for her laid-back attitude and confident nature. She loves being near her people and will be waiting for you at the door when you make it home. And when you sit down for pets, she's likely to repay you with a little bath. She's a fan of play, too, though tends to stay in one place when tackling her toys. Mini would be a perfect match for someone looking for a single feline friend.
