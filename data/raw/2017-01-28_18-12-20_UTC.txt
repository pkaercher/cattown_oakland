Charlotte is the lap cat you've been looking for! This senior lady thrives in the company of her people. She's a little wobbly in her back legs, but since her favorite activity is lap cuddles, it doesn't get in the way of her happiness! Celebrate #SeniorCatSaturday to its fullest by adopting Charlotte. Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a visit to her foster home, and be sure to check out her full bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/charlotte 🐈
