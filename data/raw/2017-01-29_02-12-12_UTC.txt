We're thinking it's about time brother/sister duo, Valentin (right) and Veronique, found their new family! These teen kittens are total loves - with each other, with other cats, and with people. They are still on the shyer side, but are huge fans of pets (and treats!). We're almost closed for the day, but you can make a reservation for tomorrow online at www.bookeo.com/cattown. Maybe you'l find the feline friend/s you've been dreaming of!
