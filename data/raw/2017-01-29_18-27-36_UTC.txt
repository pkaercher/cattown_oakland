Emmett & Fletcher are laid-back and full of love. They're a pair of purr machines - Fletcher will even start purring when he sees Emmett getting attention from accross the room! Emmett, the 7-year-old snowy-white, loves playtime and attention. He'll often run over when called, eager for back scratches. Fletcher can be a bit more reserved, but will get in on the fun when the time is right - maybe even for nelly rubs! And when you're not home, they'll keep each other great company. Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting with them, and read more at www.cattownoakland.org/emmett-and-fletcher 🐈
