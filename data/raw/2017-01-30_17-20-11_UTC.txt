Good morning from Shaz, who has taken to playing in the Tribune Tower on this Monday morning. He's keeping an eye on closed day operations while we acclimate 6 new cats to the Cat Zone after another great week of adoptions. If you're interested in adopting, you can see all of our available cats online at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt, and reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
