Sweet Reina is the perfect lap cat! This friendly 4-year-old is happiest when she's sitting on or near her humans. Getting pet is a bonus, but she'll enjoy just hanging out too. Although she can startle at a surprise, she loves getting attention. When it's not cuddle time, she'll happily chase after her toys! Reina can be a bit particular, and as the queen of the house she expects to get what she wants. She'd do best in a calm environment with adults who know how to listen to her needs.
