Black cats are very near and dear to our hearts at Cat Town. That's why we're so excited when we can help them find their new families! This past week, Jasper (top left), Ramen (bottom left), and Miranda - seen here helping her adopter complete the final paper work - were three of the Cat Town cats to get adopted. We've got a new blog post up on the site, highlighting some of our recently adopted black cats. Visit cattownoakland.org/cat-town-blog/black-cats to check it out! 🐈
