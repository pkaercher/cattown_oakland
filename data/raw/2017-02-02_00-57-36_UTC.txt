FOSTER NEEDED: Senior Woolsey is looking for a gentle, cat savvy care giver who can help him with his GI issues. Because of his health, it can be hard for Woolsey to enjoy petting, but he does like a few brushes here and there near feeding time. Mostly, he is in need of a comfortable, cat free space with a loving companion. Any foster inquiries can be sent to info@cattownoakland.org. Please help us spread the word about Woolsey 🐈
