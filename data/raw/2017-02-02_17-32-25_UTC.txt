Playtime in the daytime - that's Oswald's motto! This energetic 1-2-year-old is looking for a family to help him maintain his athletic physic. Just grab a toy and watch his inner hunter come out in full force! Oswald dreams of a space all his own (no dogs or other cats), where he can run around and maybe access some structured outdoor space. And pets from his people are a non-negotiable! Reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a visit to Oswald's foster home and make this life-of-the-party yours! üêà
