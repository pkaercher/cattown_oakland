Matilda is new to the Cat Zone this week, and despite some vision impairment, has been courageously exploring the space, playing with toys, and even engaging in some pets! She's looking for an adopter who can help her with her eye meds and give her gentle home. Come meet her today until 7PM at 2863 Broadway 🐈
