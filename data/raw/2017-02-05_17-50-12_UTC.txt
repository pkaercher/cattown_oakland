We've got a very full day ahead of us in the Cat Zone, so if you're planning a visit, we recommend making a reservation online at www.bookeo.com/cattown. And if you're planning on adopting, feel free to take a look at all our available cats, like Atlas here, online at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt. We'll be open at 2863 Broadway until 7PM today 🐈
