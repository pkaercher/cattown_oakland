Some of our followers may remember that King was hissing, swatting, and untouchable when we first met him at the shelter. Nowadays, he's a playful, fun-loving, companion to his foster family. He's a great example of a cat who just needed to get out of the shelter cage to show off his personality. Read King's full bio at www.cattownoakland.org/king, and set up a meeting by emailing info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
