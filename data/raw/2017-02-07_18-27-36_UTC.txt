#TongueOutTuesday is Raine's favorite day of the week, but she's especially excited on this Tuesday because it's just one week away from her favorite holiday! You can celebrate Valentine's Day, and help our rescue cats, by downloading and printing 4 unique Cat Town cards for just $5. One of them even features Raine! Visit www.cattownoakland.org/store/cat-town-valentines to download and print 🐈
