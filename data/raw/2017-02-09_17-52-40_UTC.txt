We recently took a trip to see foster cat, Trevor. During our visit, his foster mom told us that, despite a period of apprehension when he first arrived, he is now completely devoted to her, snuggling up beside her in bed whenever given the chance. But he also believes that love goes two ways, and wants his person to give him the same devotion in return. We think Trevor's perfect adopter will be a kind, patient person, willing to give him time to reveal his true, companionable self.
