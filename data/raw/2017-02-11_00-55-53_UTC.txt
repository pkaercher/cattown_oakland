Looks like former foster, Iona (FKA Missy), is getting in the Valentine's Day spirit, in this beautiful photo captured by @nautiluslens. We love seeing our rescue cats living happily ever after. Be sure to use the #CatTownAlum hashtag or tag us (@CatTownOak), so we can follow along with all their adventures! 🐈
