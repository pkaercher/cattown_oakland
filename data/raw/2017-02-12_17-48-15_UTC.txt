As we start construction on our expanded adoption center, we want to put the call out to our Cat Town community for short term fosters. Usually, if a Cat Zone cat comes down with an illness, we give them time to recover in our holding space. But with that space under construction, we'll need to move those cats in to temporary homes. If you're interested in being a short term foster, please email info@cattownoakland.org, and please share with family and friends 🐈
