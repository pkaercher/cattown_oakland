Happy #SeniorCatSunday! Solomon is a fluffy  Maine coon with an impressive ruff! This energetic senior kitty loves his feather wand and is a huge fan of treats. When he's not chasing after his favorite things, Solomon likes to lie next to his foster's legs. He's companionable and talkative, but needs an understanding companion who will be gentle with pets. If you can give this low-maintenance guy a home, email at info@cattownoakland.org to schedule a meeting! See his full bio at www.cattownoakland.org/solomon 🐈
