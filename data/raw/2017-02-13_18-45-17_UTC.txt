The Cat Zone is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays so we can acclimate our new cats, but if you're interested in adopting you can always email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting. You can see all our adoptable cats, like bonded pair, Salem (left) and Raine here, online at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt 🐈
