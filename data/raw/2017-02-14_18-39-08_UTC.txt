Can you feel the love? These 6 cats sure can! They all found their homes this past week. Clockwise from top left - fluffy bonded buddies, Rico & Shaz, Marty, Blaze, Gwyn, and February, who came to us through our partners at Feral Change. Most of these cats started as under socialized, and will still need some time adjusting in their new homes, but all have made huge progress since arriving at Cat town. Happy Valentine's Day to all these new families! 🐈
