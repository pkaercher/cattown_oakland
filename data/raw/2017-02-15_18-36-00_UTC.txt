#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Memo came to the Cat Zone back in the fall and was finding the environment a little stressful, so we moved him to a calm foster home. Shortly there after he was adopted! We recently received this update: I wanted to write to you to let you know that Memo is doing GREAT in his new home! His favorite hobbies include staring at birds out the window, using his cat scratcher, and stretching out in front of the heater. He's also been very cuddly and will jump up in our laps for pets. He's a wonderful cat!" Based on the photo, we'd say Memo found the relaxing home he was looking for! If you've adopted a Cat Town cat, be sure to tag #CatTownAlum üêà
