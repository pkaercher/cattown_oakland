Nikki and Drake are a sweet, but wary bonded pair looking for a gentle foster or permanent home. A pet-free space would suit their needs best. They love to play, chasing toys all over the house, and will follow up playtime with a serious snuggle session. A low-stress home will be the key to these cuties' hearts! If you're able to foster, or adopt please email info@cattownoaklan.org, and share with your family and friends 🐈
