May can't believe it, but it's true! All adoption fees are waived for qualified adopters through the end of our construction period. May is especially excited about this because she, and her bonded partner, August, are ready to find their family this week. Stop by and meet them, and our 12 other adoptable Cat Zone cats today at 2869 Broadway, from Noon to 7PM. And be sure to check out all the Cat Town cats available for adoption online at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt 🐈
