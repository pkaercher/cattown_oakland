We think bonded buddies, Emmett and Fletcher, are just about the cutest pair around. Emmett (white fur) might be more likely to start purring during petting time, but Fletcher won't take long to join in! They've also been known to groom each other, which only adds to the cuteness factor. These two are currently in a Cat Town foster home, but think it's about time to find their permanent digs. Maybe your house is the place for them! Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting, and read their full bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/emmett-and-fletcher 🐈
