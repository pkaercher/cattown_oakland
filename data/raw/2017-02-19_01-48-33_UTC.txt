2-year-old Ellie is a fan of food, lounging, pets, and play. Belly rubs are a must with this cutie, and when it's time to hunt, watch her take off down the hall after her favorite toy - the ever elusive laser beam. Ellie is looking for a calm, quiet home with a patient, understanding adopter who will help her continue to build her confidence.
