Daisy Mae is finishing up her first week in the Cat Zone. While she can be on the shyer side, she's been enjoying lots of pets from our volunteers and visitors all week long, and hopes her new family will come scoop her up soon! We're open today from 10AM to 5PM, so come meet her and all our adoptable cats at 2869 Broadway 🐈
