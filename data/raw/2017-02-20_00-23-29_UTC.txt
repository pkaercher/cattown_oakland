It’s a very exciting #SeniorCatSunday for Solomon, because his new family just signed the papers on his adoption! When Solomon arrived at the shelter, he was dealing with some hip pain that ended up being arthritis. But with some TLC from his foster, Solomon was able to increase his mobility, and now he’s going to a loving home with another senior cat companion. Finding seniors loving homes is a major part of the Cat Town mission. You can see all our current senior fosters up for adoption online at www.cattownoakland.org/senior-cats 🐈
