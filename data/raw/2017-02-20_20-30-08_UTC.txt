Truman is a super sweet, super confident cat who lives for pets and affection. He'll need a home where he can exercise his hunter's spirit with lots of play, and a cat-savvy adopter would best suit his needs. Once he's worn out from chasing his toys, you can expect lots of lap cuddles on the couch. Truman would like to be a solo cat, but might enjoy a home with older teen kids. This sweet boy is ready to be your new best friend! Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting with Truman 🐈
