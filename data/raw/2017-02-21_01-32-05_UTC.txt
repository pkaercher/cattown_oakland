Raine is keeping an eye on the storm outside while we work on cleaning up the Cat Zone for the coming week. Both Raine, and her bonded parter, Salem, would love to find their family when we open our doors on Wednesday morning. Adoption fees are waived for qualified adopters through the end of our construction period, so now is the perfect time to find your feline soulmate/s.
