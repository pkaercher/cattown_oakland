We went and visited foster cat, Adeline, yesterday, to see how she's doing in her foster home. While she's still hesitant with new people, we just moved slowly to ease her nerves, and engaged in play time and even a few pets. Adeline's foster mom tells us that they have built great trust, and when it's just them, they'll curl up together on the couch. Adeline has done a great job increasing her confidence, and we think she might do well with another mellow, somewhat confident cat. Read Adeline's full bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/adeline and email info@cattownoakland.org to adopt 🐈
