8-10-year-old Woolsey has made major progress in his short term foster home. In just a few days he's really come out of his shell, climbing into bed for pets and affection, and purring the whole time. But now he's looking for a more permanent foster or even better, an adopter, who can give him the loving, single cat home he deserves. If you're able to foster Woolsey, or would like to learn more about adopting him, please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org. Please share to help Woolsey find a home 🐈
