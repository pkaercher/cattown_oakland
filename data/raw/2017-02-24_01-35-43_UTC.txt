Sweet foster cat Jenkins is looking for a companion who can offer him all the belly rubs his little tummy desires! When he's looking for some play, he'll dedicate himself to capturing his favorite toy, or discovering the nooks and crannies of his home. Just give him a safe space and a little time to come out of his shell, and he'll be your best friend soon enough. If you're interested in adopting Jenkins, please email info@cattownoakland.org and see his bio and pictures online at www.cattownoakland.org/jenkins 🐈
