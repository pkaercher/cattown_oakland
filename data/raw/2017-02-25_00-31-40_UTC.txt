Let's find Nikki and Drake a temporary or permanent home! These two are super smart and love to play - give them some time with a wand toy and space to explore, and they'll light up. If you're able to give these two a pet-free foster or adoptive home, please email info@cattownoakland.org, and read their full bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/nikki-and-drake. And spread the word if you can 🐈
