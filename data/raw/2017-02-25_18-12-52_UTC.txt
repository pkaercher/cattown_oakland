Santiago is greeting Cat Zone guests with high fives and hand shakes on the bridge this morning. Come down to 2869 Broadway, grab a cup of @highwirecoffee from the RAWR Coffee Bar (@eatlikealion), and enjoy your Caturday in the Cat Zone. We recommend making a reservation at www.bookeo.com/cattown to reserve your entry on busy weekend days 🐈
