When one of our Cat Zone cats comes down with an illness, we usually give them time to recover next door in our holding space. But while we're under construction those cats have been recovering in short term foster homes, and are still available for adoption y appointment. You can meet short term fosters, Salem & Raine, Aaliyah, and Li'l Dickie by emailing info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
