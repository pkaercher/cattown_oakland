Rivers and Kimbra are a lovely pair ready to find a lovely family to match. Rivers (white fur) is the more confident of the two and will take the lead when it's time for play and pets. Kimbra (flame point) tends to be a little more reserved, but takes her cues from Rivers, moving into pets when she feels ready. And when the two are both feeling snuggly, you can expect to find them intertwined in their favorite cat bed.
