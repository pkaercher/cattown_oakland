We're seeing a #SeniorCatSunday pattern that we can't get enough of - adoptions! 8-10-year-old Charlotte found her family this week and we think she and they couldn't be luckier! Interested in bringing some wisdom home in the form of a furry friend? Visit www.cattownoakland.org/senior-cats to see all our current adoptable seniors 🐈
