Sibling pair, Perry (left) and Phoebe are a 5-year-old duo who stick together! They're getting used to navigating the world with humans but enjoy pets and have started testing out the lap-cat life. A patient adopter with some cat experience would help these two continue to build their confidence. Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
