We stopped by the shelter with our Foster Coordinator, Dawn, to meet some of the future Cat Town cats. These cats might be stressed, injured, senior - any number of things that require Cat Town's resources. If you'd like to help us keep helping Oakland's at-risk shelter cats, please consider making a donation of any size at www.cattownoakland.org/donate 🐈 (Psst...swipe for more photos!)
