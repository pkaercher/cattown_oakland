#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: May and August were recently adopted after coming to Cat Town when their caregiver passed away. They were clearly missing life as house cats, but are now enjoying all the comforts of a new home and a new, loving family. Their adopter writes, "We really love them so much, and they have adjusted surprisingly fast. May is really energetic and loves to play, where as August is a cuddler...Thank you again for bringing these lovely being into our life!" And to that, we say thank YOU for adopting them!
