1-year-old duo, Baldwin (left) and Georgia are the perfect pair for an adopter looking for variety. Baldwin tends to be on the shyer side, but love pets from his people when he's feeling safe and comfortable. Georgia tends to be less interested in pets, but is playful and curious - she'll usually be waiting for you by the door when you get home. We think these two would even benefit from another confident feline companion to help guide them. Interested in adoption?
