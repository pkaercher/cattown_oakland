With a personality as charming as his looks, we can't say we're surprised that Roman was adopted after less than a week in the Cat Zone! Now it's time for our other cats to find their homes. Visit www.cattownoakland.org/adopt to see current cats, and visit us in the Cat Zone today from 10AM to 5PM at 2869 Broadway 🐈
