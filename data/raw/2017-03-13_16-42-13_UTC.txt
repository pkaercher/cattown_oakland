Gentle senior girl, Maisy, is an easy going, lovable lady looking for a mellow home to call her own. Her adopter will need to help her stay on a special diet for IBD, but she'll show her gratitude with lots of cuddles on the couch. If you're the sweet, compassionate adopter Maisy is looking for, then reach out to info@cattownoakland.org, and read her bio at www.cattownoakland.org/maisy üêà
