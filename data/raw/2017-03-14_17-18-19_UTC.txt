Adeline is our official spokescat for #TongueOutTuesday - she celebrates every week! Whether it's Tuesday or not, Adeline can be usually be found playing with her favorite string toys, or curling up on the couch with her foster mom. If you can give Adeline a little time to warm up to her new space and new people, she'll be begging for belly rubs in no time.
