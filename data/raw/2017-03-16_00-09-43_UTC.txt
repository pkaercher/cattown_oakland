We just hung out most recent addition to the foster cat art show in the Cat Zone featuring Tyler (B&W) and Marlo. Tyler and Marlo are a sweet pair, the first a fan of independence and exploration, the later the more affectionate companion. Together they're a complete package! Check out their bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/Tyler-and-Marlo, and email info@cattownoakland.org with any adoption inquiries 🐈
