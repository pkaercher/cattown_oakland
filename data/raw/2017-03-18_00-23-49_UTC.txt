We captured this moment between resident window cat, Daisy Mae, and her new canine friend, yesterday afternoon. We think Daisy Mae did a great job being brave, and the pup was so excited to meet her through the glass! We're open today until 7PM at 2869 Broadway, so come by and kick off your weekend with our adoptable cats 🐈
