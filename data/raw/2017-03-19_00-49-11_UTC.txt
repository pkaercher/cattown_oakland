Lily has gone to her new foster home! Now we're looking for 4 more fosters to help us get Hope, Enzo, Fernando, and Harmony out of the shelter. Please visit www.cattownoakland.org/cats-needing-fosters to learn more about these cats, and please email info@cattownoakland.org if you or someone you know can foster! 🐈
