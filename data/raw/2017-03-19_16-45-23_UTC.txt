We can't believe it, but today is the sixth anniversary of Cat Town. While the cafe was established about two and a half years ago, the Cat Town organization has been in operation since March of 2011. Since then, we've helped more than 1,500 cats between our foster program and our adoption center, and can't wait to help even more cats with our expansion in 2017! Thank you all for supporting us over the years, we couldn't do it without you 🐈
