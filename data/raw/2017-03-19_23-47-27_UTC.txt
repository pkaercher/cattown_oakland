Bonded buddies, Raine (left) and Salem, are two of our recently adopted cats! These two came to us a few months back as part of our Forgotten Kittens project, where we work to help under socialized kittens get out of the shelter. If you'd like to help us keep saving Oakland's at-risk shelter cats, please consider making a donation of any size online at www.cattownoakland.org/donate 🐈
