Emmett (white fur) and Fletcher are rearing and ready to find their adopters! These two are truly bonded - grooming together, snuggling together, playing together - they are total love bugs. And now, they're ready to fill your home with that love! Give them some time to get used to the space and watch them flourish. Emmett will be the more outgoing one, but Fletcher won't be far behind, both looking for pets, and purring up a storm. Interested in meeting this senior pair?
