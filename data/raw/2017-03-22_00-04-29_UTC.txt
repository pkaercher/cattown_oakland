Bonded brothers, Rowan and Reed, are looking for an urgent foster! This pair is affectionate and playful, and we think would do best in a home as the only pets. Give them space to explore and chase their favorite toys, and they'll return the favor with sweet cheek rubs and head butts. Check out their full bio at www.cattownoakland/org/rowan-and-reed, and email info@cattownoakland.org to foster! 🐈
