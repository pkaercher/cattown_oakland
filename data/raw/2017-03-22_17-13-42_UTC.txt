#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: When we met senior girl, Meeka, at the shelter she had recently been surrendered and was finding the environment stressful. So she went to a foster home, and a few months back found her adopter! We recently received this update: "[Meeka] is doing well and loving her new back yard. She is quite the explorer! She continues to love laps at all times and even under-the-cover snuggles. We love her so!"
