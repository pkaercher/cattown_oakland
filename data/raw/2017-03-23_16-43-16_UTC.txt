Nikki and Drake are still looking for their family! These two are a playful pair who need a home all their own (no other pets, please). They're most in need of a patient, understanding adopter who can help them keep building confidence in a calm environment. Check out their bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/nikki-and-drake, and email info@cattownoakland.org to inquire about adopting 🐈
