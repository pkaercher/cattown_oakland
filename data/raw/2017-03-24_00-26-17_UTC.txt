Another adoption to report from last week! Elsa, who was a long term favorite in the Cat Zone, went home with a member of the Cat Town staff! Her new adopters couldn't be more excited to help her continue to grow. If you're thinking about adopting visit www.cattownoakland.org/adopt to see all our current cats! 🐈
