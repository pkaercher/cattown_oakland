Can you be a foster to Harmony? This sweet girl is very confident and affectionate, but because of her permanently injured paw, we'd like to get her out of the shelter and into a more comfortable foster home ASAP! And don't forget, we provide all the supplies you'll need to foster! Please email info@cattownoakland.org for more details, and please share if you can! 🐈
