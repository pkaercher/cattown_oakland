Handsome tux, TC has an adorable personality and is sure to charm his way into your heart! He's still coming out of his shell, but he's quickly turning into a lap cat and loves attention! At 1-year-old, he loves to chase his feather toy around, human or not. When he's not playing, TC likes to strike up a conversation with his fosters using a wide range of meows, chirps, and trills!
