Trevor is a sweet, 3-year-old boy looking for his human soulmate. While he isn't as keen on a feline companion, given the right amount of time, Trevor will be nothing less than a BFF to his human. This boy will take some time to find his footing in a new space, but if you can show him patience, trust, and understanding, he'll show you love and affection in return.
