FOSTER NEEDED: Bonded brothers, Rowan and Reed, are looking for a foster home where they can enjoy ribbon toy hunting and cheek scratches a plenty. Rowan is a little more confident, but Reed won't be far behind, ready to explore. We think they would do best in a home as the only cats, but might enjoy the company of cat savvy kids or teens. Email info@cattownoakland.org if you or someone you know can foster! üêà
