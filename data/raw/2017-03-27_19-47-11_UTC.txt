If you've visited the Cat Zone recently, you may have met Gibson. Gibson is like a lot of Cat Town cats we had before. He likes pets, but is still fairly nervous around humans. This can be confusing because he might be enjoying someone's company, but exhibiting anxiety at the same time. That's why we're giving him some extra time to build confidence in the Cat Zone before he's available for adopted. Come meet him and all our Cat Zone cats when we open on Wednesday morning at 10AM 🐈
