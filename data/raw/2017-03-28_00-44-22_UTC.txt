Sweet Woolsey is still looking for a long term foster or adopter. This senior guy is a huge fan of pets and will initiate affection with lots of head butts. Give him a couple days to adjust to his new surroundings, and soon you'll find him following you around the house. If you'd like to foster or adopt Woolsey, please email info@cattownoakland.org, and spread the word if you can! 🐈
