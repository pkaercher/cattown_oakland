Sweet senior Maisy would make a perfect cuddle buddy for someone looking for a low-key cat! She's got a laid-back and gentle demeanor, and doesn't ask for much. Her foster says she likes to welcome her homeat the end of the day and loves being pet - she's even a fan of belly rubs! Email info@cattownoakland.org to schedule a meeting with her, and read her bio at www.cattownoakland.org/maisy 🐈
