When we met Milo at the shelter he would swat at anything or anyone that entered his cage. But knowing he was a surrender, we thought he might just need to get back into a home to feel safe again. So yesterday, he made his way to his foster home, and is already feeling so much better. He spent his first day exploring and getting lots of pets!
