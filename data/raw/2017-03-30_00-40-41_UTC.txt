#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Little Ludwig came to Cat Town a few months back in need of eye surgery. He was totally a trooper, didn't let the surgery dampen his spirits in any way, and was adopted shortly after recovering! His adopter recently wrote in to tell us how well he is doing and how much they love him! You too can find your feline soulmate! Visit www.cattownoakland.org/adopt to see all our current cats 🐈
