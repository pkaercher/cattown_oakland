We heard today was #NationalStripesDay, but when we hear stripes, we immediately think of tabbies! We've got a number of tabbies up for adoption right now, some sporting lots of stripes, some just a few, but no matter the number, we want to celebrate. It's really more like National Tabby Day to us! Learn more about our adoptable tabbies online at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt 🐈
