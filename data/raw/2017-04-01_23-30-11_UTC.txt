FOSTERS NEEDED! We have three cats at the shelter we're hoping to move into foster homes as soon as possible! Emilio is our top priority - he is as sweet as can be, but needs a small, quiet space where his paw can continue to heal. Learn more about each of these cats online at www.cattownoakland.org/cats-needing-foster, and email info@cattownoakland.org if you can foster! üêà
