Fun loving, Cosima can turn a cardboard box into anything - a submarine, a bicycle, or even a rocket ship! When she's not on an adventure, she can be found spending time with her foster parents exploring the house, and is always ready to greet them home for the day. She might even crawl into their laps if she's feeling cozy! Ready to bring Cosima home with you? Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting.
