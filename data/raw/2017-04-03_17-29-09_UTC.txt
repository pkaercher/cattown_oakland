We're still on the lookout for a foster or adopter for bonded brothers, Rowan and Reed. This pair is a good balance of playful and affectionate; find them chasing the ribbon toy and following up with requests for chin and cheek scratches. If you can give them just a little time to adjust to their new space, they'll be your buddies in no time. Email info@cattownoakland.org to foster, and please share with your friends and family üêà
