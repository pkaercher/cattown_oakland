Gerty was briefly adopted last week, but made her way back to the Cat Zone when it wasn't the right fit. Now she's heading home with her new family! She's a real cuddle bug, and will get to enjoy lots of snuggles with her new feline family member! All adoption fees are waived for qualified adopters through the end of our Cat Town construction.
