Georgia and Baldwin are two sweet 1-year-olds looking for their home. Georgia takes the lead when it comes to playtime, tackling any and all ribbon and ball toys. Baldwin is a little more reserved, enjoying independent time in his cat tree. The two of them are both learning to interact with humans, and continue to build a positive relationship with their foster. Baldwin even enjoys cheek and chin scratches while lounging.
