This #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday features Gilly (FKA Treseme), who just celebrated one year with her adopters! @directorebeccer posted that she is "full of adventure, love, belly floof, and tiny squeaks that she shakes out of herself as she bounces around the house." We love hearing how our cats are doing, whether it's been six months or six years since their adoption! Be sure to tag #CatTownAlum so we can follow along!
