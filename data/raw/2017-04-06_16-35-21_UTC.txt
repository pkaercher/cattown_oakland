URGENT FOSTER OR ADOPTER NEEDED! At Cat Town, we're dedicated to finding homes for all of Oakland's at-risk shelter cats. Buster is one of those cats. He's a 13-year-old senior who's been handling his thyroid disease and mild kidney disease like a champ! On a more recent vet visit, we learned Buster could also have small cell lymphoma. What that means right now is that we're not sure how long Buster has, but we are sure he deserves a home where he can soak up lots of pets and be as comfortable as possible, no matter what. Buster is a total sweetheart, and would love nothing more than to be your only kitty companion. His vet bills will be covered by Cat Town, and a generous donor has kindly offered to pay for his thyroid meds for 6 months following his adoption. If you are able to foster Buster, or if you'd like to adopt him, please email info@cattownoakland.org, and visit www.cattownoakland.org/buster to learn more about this sweet boy üêà
