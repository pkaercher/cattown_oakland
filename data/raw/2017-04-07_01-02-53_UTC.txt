Daisy Mae has become a sun bathing professional - if there's a ray to catch, she's catching it! In between warming her fur, she can usually be found watching the traffic on Broadway or chasing down the cat dancer toy. If you're ready to adopt, she might just be your girl! Stop by 2869 Broadway this weekend and take home a new best friend! 🐈
