@petfoodexpress is raising the final $30,000 needed to complete construction of our new adoption center at Cat Town. Under socialized kittens, like Tally (front) and Shay, will be able to build positive relationships with humans in the safety of our new enclosure spaces. Be sure to stop into any of the four Oakland Pet Food Express locations, now through April 18th, to make a donation. Please visit www.facebook.com/petfoodexpress for more details üêà
