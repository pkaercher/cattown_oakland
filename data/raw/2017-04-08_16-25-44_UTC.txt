It's hard to believe Woolsey still hasn't found his home! He's actually in the market for a more permanent foster, but would certainly be happiest if he found his adopter. This senior guy is sweet as can be, and will just need a little time to get used to his new space. We think he would do best in a kid-free home, but might do ok with another mellow cat. If you're an experienced cat owner looking for a snuggle buddy, email info@cattownoakland.org to foster or adopt Woolsey. Visit www.cattownoakland.org/woolsey to read his full bio üêà
