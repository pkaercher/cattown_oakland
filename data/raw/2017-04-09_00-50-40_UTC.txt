Toby tends to be more of an explorer than a hunter, but we recently discovered his love for these feather toys! His future adopter will want to stock up! If you didn't get to spend your Caturday in the Cat Zone, be sure to come visit us tomorrow when we open at 10AM at 2869 Broadway. All adoption fees are waived for qualified adopters through the end of construction 🐈
