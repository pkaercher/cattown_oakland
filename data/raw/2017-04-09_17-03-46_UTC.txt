CALLING ALL FOSTERS! Bonded buddies, Lorenzo and Vinnie, are in need of a temporary space ASAP! These two are totally sweet, but Vinnie is feeling especially stressed, and we'd like to get them settled into a home where they can relax and spend time away from other cats. We provide all the supplies you'll need to care for these two, all you have to do is provide the love and patience. If you're able to foster, please email info@cattownoakland.org, and spread the word if you can üêà
