Who's ready for some feather chasing?! Paisley sure is! She'll happily tackle any wand toy that flies through the air. With her playful spirit, we think she'd enjoy the company of another feline friend. Her only request is that you give her a little time and patience to adjust to her new space. Once she's settled, and played to her hearts content, she'll likely welcome some gentle pets! Interested in adopting this green eyed beauty?
