We have a number of cats currently in the Cat Zone that came to us through our partners at @feralchange, including bonded siblings, Tulip (left) and Jack. They're getting used to people and learning how to love pets. Come hang out with these two when we open on Wednesday! Make a reservation for the Cat Zone online at www.bookeo.com/cattown #nationalsiblingsday 🐈
