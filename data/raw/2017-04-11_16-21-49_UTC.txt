Buster is still looking for a foster or adopter! This senior boy is a total sweetheart with an easy-going temperament, and has been handling his thyroid disease and mild kidney disease like a champ! We recently learned he might also have small cell lymphoma, and it's possible he might be a fospice cat. If someone is interested in adopting, Buster's vet bills will be covered by Cat Town, and a generous donor has kindly offered to pay for his thyroid meds for 6 months following adoption. If you're the special guardian Buster is looking for, please email info@cattownoakland.org, and visit www.cattownoakland.org/buster to learn more about this sweet boy üêà
