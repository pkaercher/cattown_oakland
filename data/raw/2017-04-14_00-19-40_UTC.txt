Confident Cosima is an easygoing companion who's both friendly and comfortably independent! She's good at communicating what she wants, and usually it's pets! At 2 years old, she loves to play, especially with her fishing toy! When the mood strikes her, she'll sit in your lap, but more often you'll find her sitting in boxes. She enjoys a laid-back lifestyle and you'll sometimes catch her on her back with her tiny paws in the air!
