Sweet, little Allie is a real people cat. Her fosters say she loves to stay near-by and snuggle up in the bed. But she's a real cat-cat, too, and enjoys the company of her two foster siblings. We think she'll do well in a home with another cat to look up to. When she's not in cuddle mode, she can usually be found chasing down her favorite toys and playing with her feline friends. Give her a little time to adjust and she'll be purring up a storm in no time. Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting, and read her full bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/allie üêà
