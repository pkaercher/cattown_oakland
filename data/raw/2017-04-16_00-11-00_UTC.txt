We need a foster for 6-month-old Gilbert! He'll be receiving much needed surgery for his leg this Monday and will need a comfortable space to heal afterwards. An experienced foster who can administer his meds and bring him to the vet would be the perfect fit! Please let us know if you can foster Gilbert by emailing info@cattownoakland.org, and if you can help us spread the word, please share with your friends 🐈
