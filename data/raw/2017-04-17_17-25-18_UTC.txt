With his big eyes and affectionate nature, it's hard to resist Frankie! This 15-year-old boy loves nothing more than spending an afternoon soaking up sunbeams and spending time with his people. He's even a fan of yoga, showing off his stretching skills every evening along side his foster mom. As is often the case with seniors, Frankie will require a little extra attention around his diet, but he'll be sure to show his gratitude with bedtime snuggles and evening chats. Turning into a Frankie-phile as we speak? Reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting, and read more about him at www.cattownoakland.org/frankie 🐈
