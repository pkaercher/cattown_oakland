CALLING ALL FOSTERS! Gilbert is resting up after his surgery, but her still needs a foster home! His leg was injured from a gunshot wound, and it's not totally clear how long he was living with the pain, but we're very happy he's receiving this long needed medical attention. Now he's looking for someone who can help him continue to heal while he waits for his future adopter. He'll need someone comfortable administering meds and bringing him to the vet for follow-up appointments. Do you have a safe space and a big heart for Gilbert? Email info@cattownoakland.org, and please share! üêà
