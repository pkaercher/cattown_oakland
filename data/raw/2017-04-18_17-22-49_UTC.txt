Alaska, (top) is showing new girl, Cricket, the comforts of the Victorian! We've noticed that cats who are maybe a little wary of all the activity in the Cat Zone, but want to be accessible to pets, find the Victorian to be a safe space! Come spend some time with Alaska, Cricket, and our 11 other adoptable cats when we open for the week tomorrow morning at 10AM üêà
