Beautiful 7-year-old Hope loves snuggling up in laps and doesn't ask for much in return! She'll hop on your lap as soon as you sit down and start purring right away! This cuddly cat would be great for someone who's looking for a low-maintainence, affectionate companion! She might do well with older, cat-savvy kids or a just adult guardians who can give her a solo cat home. Email info@cattownoakland.org to meet her, and read her bio at www.cattownoakland.org/hope 🐈
