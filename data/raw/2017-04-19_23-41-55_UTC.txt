#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: When Elsa arrived at Cat Town, she was extremely under socialized. She had a few setbacks during her time in our care, including needing a 2 month treatment for a skin condition, but with time and patience, Elsa was able to become a confident, playful cat. Her adopters (who happen to work with Cat Town) tell us that she has been doing wonderfully, playing with her toys, exploring the house, enjoying treats, and even pets! A happy ending if we ever heard one! If you're interested in adopting, email info@cattownoakland.org and check out our current cats online at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt üêà
