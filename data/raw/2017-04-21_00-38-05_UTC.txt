Senior gal, Monkey is a sweetheart if there ever was one! Her foster says she greets her at the door when she comes home, and will purr like crazy when being brushed. She's happy with independent time as well, and will relax the day away when you're out of the house. Though she tends to really enjoy lounging, you'll likely find her being playful if you break out the laser pointer! All Monkey needs is a patient adopted who knows that "tortitude" is just part of her multifaceted personality, and love is all she needs to be happy!
