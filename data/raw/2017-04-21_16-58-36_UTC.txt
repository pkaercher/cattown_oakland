FOSTER NEEDED! Sweet Eddie is at the shelter dealing with some dental issues, and because of his FIV+ status, we'd like to get him into a calm foster home as soon as possible. He'll be receiving treatment for his teeth from the Friends of Oakland Animal Services, but he needs a kind and gentle space where he can relax after the fact. If you're able to give him a comfortable space, email info@cattownoakland.org, and please share if you can! 🐈
