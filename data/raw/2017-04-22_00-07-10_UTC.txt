New to the Cat Zone this week, Star is learning how to navigate the space and interact with humans. She's working on strengthening her confidence before being ready for adoption, so come by and help her build positive relationships! You can make a weekend reservation to visit the Cat Zone online at www.bookeo.com/cattown! 🐈
