Zelda's fosters rave that she might be the perfect cat, and with good reason! Friendly and gentle, this 2-year-old is a total sweetheart! She loves belly rubs and being held, sometimes like a baby! Zelda does well on her own, but will also come running when she hears the wand toy come out. She's curious and intelligent, and quick to warm up to new people and places. As a laid-back and even-tempered cat, she'll probably do just fine with children or another feline companion.
