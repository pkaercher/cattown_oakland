Foster heros, our cats need you! We're looking to get Didi, bonded pair Lenny & Rory, Eddie, Bastille, and Bud out of the shelter as soon as possible. If you or someone you know is looking to become a Cat Town foster parent, please email info@cattownoakland.org, and check out little bios for each of these cats on our website at www.cattownoakland.org/cats-needing-foster 🐈
