Welcome to the Cat Zone, Ares! He'll be making his debut when we open on Wednesday morning at 10AM. All our Cat Zone cats are looking for loving families, so if you're interested in adopting, be sure to visit www.cattownoakland.org/adopt. All adoption fees are waived through the end of our construction for qualified applicants! 🐈
