Aristotle once wrote, "“What is the essence of life? To serve others and to do good", and no one better demonstrates that essence than our incredible fosters and volunteers. Know that while we're celebrating you during National Volunteer Week (4/23 - 4/29), we are so beyond appreciative of all you give to the Cat Town cats on a daily basis, and would be nowhere without your dedication. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making an immeasurable difference in the lives of Oakland's at-risk shelter cats 🐈
