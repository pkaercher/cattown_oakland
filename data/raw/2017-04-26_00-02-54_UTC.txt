URGENT FOSTERS NEEDED! Senior cats Miles and Maisy each need a new foster home. Both cats need to be moved from their current spaces due to housing changes. Miles is a sweet 8-year-old tabby and Maisy is a gentle 10-year-old tortie who needs a foster who can help with her diet. We need to find new homes quickly, so if you or someone you know is able to foster, please email info@cattownoakland.org, and SHARE SHARE SHARE!! üêà
