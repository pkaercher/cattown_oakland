Happy Birthday to Maddie, who would have been 30 years old today! This little dog was so beloved by Dave and Chery Duffield that they created an animal welfare foundation, @maddiesfund, to honor her memory.  That incredible love has resulted in the contribution of over $187 million in grants to animal welfare organizations, and help to over 1 million animals. If only our cats knew that a dog was behind the incredibly generous support we receive from Maddie’s Fund! #ThanksToMaddie #HappyBirthdayMaddie 🐈
