#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: During their time in the Cat Zone, Lucy (left) and Linus (FKA Jeremiah) were fairly shy and rarely ever spent time outside of their Quiet Zone cubbies. But one day, they both decided to come out for pets for volunteer, Julie W., and that was that! She adopted them shortly there after and their one year adopt-iversary date just passed. She tells us that, despite the two still being on the shyer side, they continue to make progress, most recently with the help of their new foster sibling, Ivan. Way to go, Lucy and Linus! And thank you, Julie, for giving them a loving home! If you're interested in adopting, please email info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
