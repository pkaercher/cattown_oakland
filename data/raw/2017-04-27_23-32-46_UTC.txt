We're getting ready to take part in the 2017 Saving Pets Challenge starting May 2nd, and you can help us make it the best fundraiser yet! We've found our success comes from individuals who believe in our mission championing the Cat Town mission and the cats who need us most! Asking people to donate to a cause you believe in can add up quickly. If just 10 people donate $20, you'll have changed a cat's life in no time! Visit bit.ly/cattownspc17 to help team Cat Town keep making an impact on the lives of Oakland's at-risk shelter cats! 🐈
