Bonded pair, Nikki and Drake are in need of a foster or adopter to call their own. This pair, just over a year old, love to play and keep each other entertained. They're looking for a care giver who can help them continue to grow and learn what life is like with humans. You can email info@cattownoakland.org with any questions or foster/adoption inquiries #FosterFriday 🐈
