It's #SeniorCatSunday, and we hope you might celebrate the occasion by giving Maisy a foster or adoptive home! This sweet 10-year-old girl is a total love who just needs someone who understands that a new environment can lead to stress, and stress can lead to tummy trouble. But we know a kind, compassionate care giver is out there, ready to give Maisy a comfy space. Is it you? Email info@cattownoakland.org to inquire 🐈
