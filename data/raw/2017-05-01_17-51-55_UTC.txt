Tomorrow's the first day of the 2017 saving pets challenge, and we're hoping you'll join team Cat Town to help save Oakland's at-risk shelter cats! By joining our fundraising team, you'll be able to make a huge impact. If 10 of your friends donate $20 each, that can change the life of an Oakland cat in need! So please join team Cat Town in the 2017 Saving Pets Challenge! Visit bit.ly/cattownspc17 to create your fundraising page today! 🐈
