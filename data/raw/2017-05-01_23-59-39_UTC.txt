As we work on cleaning up the Cat Zone for the coming week, our volunteers are spending some quality time with Alaska and our other cats, working to reinforce positive human interactions. We'll be closed again tomorrow but hope you'll come visit us at 2869 Broadway when we open the Cat Zone at 10am on Wednesday morning. Drop in or make a reservation online at www.bookeo.com/cattown 🐈
