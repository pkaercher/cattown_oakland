Today is the start of the 2017 Saving Pets Challenge and it's your chance to make a HUGE impact on the lives of Oakland's at-risk shelter cats! From May 2nd to June 1st, we'll be raising funds while competing with other rescue organizations to win additional prize money. Every donation goes toward our rescue efforts, AND helps get us that much closer to bonus funds that will extend our efforts even further!
Head on over to bit.ly/cattownspc17 to learn more about the sick, senior, shy, and stressed cats you'll be saving, and to make a life changing donation of any size üêà
