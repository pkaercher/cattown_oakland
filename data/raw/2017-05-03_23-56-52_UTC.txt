FOSTER NEEDED! Milo is a sweet 3-year old cat looking for a companion who can give him lots of love and affection. We think a foster who spends a lot of time at home and can give him an otherwise pet-free space would be ideal. If you or someone you know can foster Milo, please contact info@cattownoakland.org üêà
