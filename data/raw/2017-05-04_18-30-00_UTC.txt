Grayson and Natalie are two cats who might never have made it out of the shelter without Cat Town. But now, they're learning how to interact with humans and are growing confidence with the help of other cats. You can change lives for cats like Grayson and Natalie by participating in the Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser for Cat Town!
