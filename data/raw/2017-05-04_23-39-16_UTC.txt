Have you met Trevor? He's been working with his foster to build confidence and trust with humans. It took him a while to get there, but now he is completely dedicated to cuddle time! We think an understanding adopter is out there, ready to put in the time and effort, knowing it will pay off in nothing but love. Are you ready to add Trevor to your family? Ready his full bio at www.cattownoakland.org/Trevor, and email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
