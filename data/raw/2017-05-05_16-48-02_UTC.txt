Every Friday during the Saving Pets Challenge, we'll be bringing you a story of a foster cat who needed our resources to get out of the shelter and in to a comfortable foster home. First up, sweet Zelda! Check out her story and stay tuned for more #FosterFeatureFriday stories to come! And don't forget, you can help Oakland's at-risk shelter cats find loving homes by donating to our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser at bit.ly/cattownspc17 🐈
