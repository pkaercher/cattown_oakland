We're so proud of Jani and all the progress she's been making in the Cat Zone! Since arriving, she's gone from nervous and reserved to now out in the open and eager to play! Make a reservation to come meet Jani online at www.bookeo.com/cattown. And if you can't come for a visit, you can still make an impact by donating to our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser at bit.ly/cattownspc17 🐈
