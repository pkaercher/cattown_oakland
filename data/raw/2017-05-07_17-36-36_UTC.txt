FOSTER NEEDED! Affectionate and active Milo is in need of a new foster. His current caregivers are moving, but hope a new family with lots of love to give will take their place. Milo is an curious cat who thrives on his bond with his humans. We think someone who spends a decent amount of time at home will be a good partner for Milo! If you have cat experience and are interested in fostering this sweet boy, please email info@cattownoakland.org üêà
