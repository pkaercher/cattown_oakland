What does it mean to give to Cat Town during the Saving Pets Challenge? It means giving under socialized kittens a chance to build positive relationships with humans, an opportunity they might never have otherwise had. Every donation changes a life! And the first 20 donors who contribute $500 or more will be invited to the grand opening of our new adoption center expansion. Plus, any donation of $100 or more enters you into a raffle to win free Cat Zone entry for a year! What are you waiting for? Head on over to bit.ly/cattownspc17 to donate! üêà
