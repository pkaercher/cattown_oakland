Jani and Daisy Mae are making sure play time quotas are met on this closed Tuesday morning! These two are both up for adoption and are so ready to find their families. Come meet them when we open tomorrow morning at 10AM. You can also make an impact by donating to our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser at bit.ly/cattownspc17 🐈
