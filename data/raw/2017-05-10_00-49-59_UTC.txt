We're so excited for bonded pair, Perry and Phoebe, who recently found their family! Their adopter is ready to give these two the time they need to adjust to their new space and build confidence in their new home. Cat Town is dedicated to finding compassionate, loving adopters for Oakland's at-risk shelter cats. If you're interested in adopting, check out our current cats online at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt. And if you'd like to contribute to our rescue efforts, please visit bit.ly/cattownspc17 to make a donation to our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser 🐈
