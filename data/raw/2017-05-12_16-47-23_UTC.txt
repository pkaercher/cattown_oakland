In this Foster Feature Friday, senior cat Shane (currently up for adoption) talks about why he needs Cat Town. Check out his story, and if you're inspired to help other seniors escape the stress of the shelter cage, head over to bit.ly/cattownspc17 to make a donation to our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser. Every contribution goes toward our rescue efforts and pushes us closer to winning bonus prize money during the Challenge! 🐈
