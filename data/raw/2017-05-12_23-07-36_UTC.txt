CALLING ALL FOSTERS! Got a big heart and some open space in your home? Then maybe you're the foster Jura is looking for! This beautiful black cat is confident and will proudly flop over to reveal her belly as a sign of trust. She'll need an experienced cat person, and an otherwise pet free home would be best. Jura needs a foster ASAP, so if you're interested please email us at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
