Sweet and playful Billy is looking for his home. This handsome house panther is the apple of his fosters' eyes, and they love spending time with him. Playtime is the quickest way to Billy's heart, and was the first way he and his foster parents bonded. Now that he's more comfortable, he enjoys pets and even sometimes laps! He's also got a curious spirit and loves to poke his head around corners to check out the scene. Are you ready for Billy to steal your heart?
