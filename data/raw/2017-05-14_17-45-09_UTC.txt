Adorable 1-year-old duo Nikki and Drake are intelligent and adventurous! Although they can be suspicious of new faces, once you bring out the toys they start to show their playful side - they love to chase the feather dancer! When left on their own, a good perch and a few things to climb will keep them perfectly entertained. These two are looking for a calm home where they can continue to grow!
