Sweet Cameron is a curious boy learning about the world around him. His fosters have been spending lots of time helping him build confidence and have been seeing lots of progress. Playtime has been a huge part of him coming out of his shell. Cameron, though cautious in nature, is trying something new every day, and with a patient, loving adopter, he'll keep blossoming.
