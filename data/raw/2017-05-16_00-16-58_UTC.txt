Helping under socialized cats and kittens is one of the major pillars of the Cat Town mission. These cats usually arrive at Cat Town with little to no previous human interaction, and are usually passed over by other rescue organizations. But with your support we can give cats like Tulip (left) and Jack a second chance! A contribution of any size makes a difference, plus any donation of $100 or more enters you for a chance to win free Cat Zone entry for two for a whole year!
