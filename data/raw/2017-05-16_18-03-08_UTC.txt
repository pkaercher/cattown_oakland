As we head into the third week of the Saving Pets Challenge, we have an opportunity to secure some bonus money! If we can be one of two teams to raise the most between now and next Tuesday, we'll face off in a rocks-paper-scissors battle to win either $5,000 if we win, or $2,000 if we lose - which is still a win! With bonus funds, we'll be able to get more of Oakland's at-risk shelter cats into loving homes! Visit bit.ly/cattownspc17 to make a donation üêà
