Maisy may have beautiful eyes and a long fluffy coat, but she is so much more than her good looks! This is a cat who loves to snuggle - plant yourself down on the couch and get ready for a hangout. Maisy can be a little skittish when new people come around, but once she knows she can trust you, she'll welcome you in for pets. We hope that Maisy's future adopter is a gentle soul who ca help with her spacial diet. Interested in adding Maisy to the family? Please email info@cattownoakland.org.
