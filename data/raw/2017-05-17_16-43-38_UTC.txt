Charlie is getting ready to meet and greet the public on his first day back in the Cat Zone. He was adopted in the fall of 2015, but when his caregiver recently passed away, we welcomed him back to Cat Town to find him a loving home. Come meet Charlie and all our adoptable cats when we open today at 10AM at 2869 Broadway 🐈
