Cats who exhibit health issues at the shelter may never get out of the cage to get treated. And the stress of the environment can even exacerbate their issues.  That's why we're dedicated to helping cats like Bianca find loving foster homes where they can relax while being provided medical care. Check out Bianca's #FosterFeatureFriday story, and be sure to email info@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in adopting! And don't forget, whether you're near or far, you can donate to our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser online at bit.ly/cattownspc17 to make a difference in the lives of Oakland's shelter cats! 🐈
