You are all AMAZING! We asked for your help, and boy did you deliver! Since the start of our match period yesterday morning, and including the $3,000 bonus, we have raised over $15,000, getting us 70% of the way to our goal to raise $60,000! 
Not only that, but we are now in 4th place overall, putting us in the running to win an additional $10,000 bonus at the end of the Challenge! AND, if we can be one of the two teams to raise the most money this week, we could earn an additional $2,000 or $5,000 prize! 
With these potential funds, we can make a HUGE impact on the lives of Oakland’s at-risk shelter cats. Let’s keep the ball rolling!
If you haven’t yet had a chance to make a donation, head on over to bit.ly/cattownspc17. You are saving countless lives with your contributions and we can’t thank you enough! 🐈
