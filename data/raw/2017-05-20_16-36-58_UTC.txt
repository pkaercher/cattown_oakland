UPDATE! Wyatt had found a foster home and will be leaving the shelter shortly! We are so grateful for the outpouring of kindness and generosity we see from our amazing community on a daily basis. THANK YOU!

Isn't Wyatt the sweetest little cat? This bundle of love was recently brought to the vet by a good samaritan after sustaining a hip fracture from a car accident. Now he's at the shelter and looking for a foster home! It's possible the injury can heal on its own, but he'll need to be on cage rest for 6-8 weeks, and we're looking for someone who can monitor his progress before he's re-evaluated for potential surgery. If you, or anyone you know, can foster, please email info@cattownoakland.org üêà
