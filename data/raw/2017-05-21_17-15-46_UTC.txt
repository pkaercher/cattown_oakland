It's #SeniorCatSunday and we think finding Woolsey the perfect home is the only way to celebrate! This senior boy is a sweetheart who loves to push his head into your hand for pets. Sometimes he'll dedicate time to bird watching, but his favorite hobby is following his best human friend around the house. His perfect adopter should have cat experience and be willing to help with his sometimes bowel issues. He hopes to be the only cat so he can soak up every pet for himself!
