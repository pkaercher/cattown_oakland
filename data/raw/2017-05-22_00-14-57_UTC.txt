"Who me?!" Yup, you Charlie - you've been adopted! Congrats to the new family. If you're interested in adopting through Cat Town, you can head on over to cattownoakland.org/adopt to see all our current cats. Even though our Cat Zone space is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, potential adopters can make an appointment to meet any of our cats any day of the week. Just email us at info@cattownoakland.org🐈
