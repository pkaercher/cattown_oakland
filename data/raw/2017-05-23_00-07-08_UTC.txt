As we head into summer, shelter cages across the country are filling up with litters of kittens. Many of these kittens grow up in the cage, with little opportunity to socialize with humans or make their way out of the shelter. 
That’s why we started our Forgotten Kitten Project to help cats like Eva and Judith go from frightened shelter kittens to loving companions. But we can’t do the work alone. 
Your donation can help save lives in more way than one. We’re currently in the running to earn a bonus prize of up to $5,000 if we can be one of the top two fundraisers from this past week! Plus, any donations made between now and tomorrow morning are entered to win an after-hours party in the Cat Zone for you and up to five friends. Don’t delay, the bonus challenge period ends tomorrow at 10:59 AM PST. Head over to bit.ly/cattownspc17 to make a donation and make a difference! 🐈
