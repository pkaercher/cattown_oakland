We're down to the final two hours in the Rock-Paper-Scissors fundraising challenge where the top two fundraising teams from the past week will face off in a high stakes game of RPS to win up to $5,000 - and Cat Town is in the running! Think of how many more cats can be saved with this potential bonus prize! And, if you make your donation by the 10:59AM PST deadline, you'll also be entered to win an after hours party for you and up to five friends in the Cat Zone. Head on over to bit.ly/cattownspc17 to make a donation!
