Annabelle is having a blast with all our visitors this afternoon! We'll be open today until 7PM, so stop by to meet her, and our other 13 adoptable cats, at 2869 Broadway! And if you can't make it to Cat Town, but still want to help Oakland's at-risk shelter cats, you can donate to our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser at bit.ly/cattownspc17 🐈
