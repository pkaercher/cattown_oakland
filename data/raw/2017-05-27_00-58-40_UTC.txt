It's a little crazy to us how cute Gemma is! This 8-year-old girl was majorly stressed at the shelter, but is now in a foster home where she can enjoy playtime and head scratches to her hearts content while she waits for her future family to come along. Help other stressed seniors like Gemma find comfort outside the cage by donating to our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser at bit.ly/cattownspc17. Plus, all donations made before 6PM PST tomorrow (5/27) will be entered to win a Caturday morning cartoon party for 6 in the Cat Zone! Change lives and earn a chance to win a prize - how easy is that?! 🐈
