It's Saturday morning again, the beginning of the weekend, but all you've got planned are chores! What if there was something else, something better, something with a little more catitude?
You're in luck, because all donations made to our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser today before 6PM, will be entered to win a Caturday morning cartoon party in the Cat Zone for you and five guests! Or if you're more of a night owl, you can substitute for an after-hours party instead. Just head on over to bit.ly/cattownspc17 to make a donation to our life saving work 🐈
