Just one more hour to donate and be entered for a chance to win a Caturday morning cartoon party in the Cat Zone! We’re also in contention to secure a 5th place spot in the overall competition, which would help us earn a $5,000 bonus! With that we could help more shelter cats like Natalie, who need a cage free space to build confidence. Visit bit.ly/cattownspc17 to make a donation 🐈
