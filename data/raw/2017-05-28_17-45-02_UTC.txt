As we head into the final days of the Saving Pets Challenge, our Volunteer Coordinator, Jay, will be spending 24 hours walking around Oakland’s Lake Merritt to bring awareness to Cat Town’s mission. Jay takes off today at noon, and in honor of his incredible journey, we’ll be highlighting three incredible Cat Town cat journeys. First up: Trevor.

Trevor was so frozen at the shelter that we had no idea who he was. Out of the shelter, there was a glimmer there, but he’d probably never lived in a home before, and Emily, his foster mom, didn’t have experience with an under socialized cat like him. But what she did have was patience, and love.  Trevor has been able to take things slowly and move at his own pace. Now, almost two years since his arrival to Cat Town, Trevor has built a trusting, loving relationship with Emily, showing that anything is possible when a cat feels safe and loved. 
Your support makes Trevor’s second chance at life a possibility. Please support Jay, and cats like Trevor by making a donation to our Saving Pets Challenge campaign at bit.ly/cattownspc17 🐈
