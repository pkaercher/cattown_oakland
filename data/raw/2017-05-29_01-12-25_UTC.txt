As Jay heads into his seventh hour walking around Lake Merritt, we dive into Elsa’s incredible journey. Elsa was an unlikely candidate for Cat Town, seemingly feral at the shelter. But we saw something in her that made us believe it was worth taking the chance. 
During her year at Cat Town, Elsa was slow to come out of her shell. But over time, she started hitting milestones - playing out in the open, making a cat friend, and finally accepting pets.
Her adopters, Cathy and Elliot, two members of the Cat Town community, had been in love with Elsa since her arrival at Cat Town, but knew she was still in need of the Cat Zone’s resources to build her confidence. But once she was ready to go home, they were ready to have her. She grows braver and more confident every day!
