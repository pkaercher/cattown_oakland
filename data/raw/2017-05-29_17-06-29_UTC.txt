Cat Town Volunteer Coordinator, Jay is down to the final two hours of his 24 hour walk. With his incredible journey nearing its end, we wanted to highlight one final cat story. 
Zoe’s journey with Cat Town has been equal parts unexpected and unbelievable. When Zoe was injured by a BB gun shot, with a wound that was likely to reopen, her life as a feral was no longer safe. She was about 8 years old then, so it was hard to know if Zoe would ever be comfortable in a home, but the best we could do was give her a chance. 
Zoe’s foster mom, Teresa, wasn’t sure she was the guardian Zoe needed, but with an open mind and heart, she wanted to try. Zoe has been in Teresa’s care for over a year, and in that time, the two have built trust and confidence. With the help of Teresa’s cat (and Cat Town alum), Una, Zoe’s learned how to build a positive relationship with her human. 
What could have been the end for Zoe, was just the beginning of a new chapter. Now she feels safe and comfortable in her space and even accepts pets from Teresa.
