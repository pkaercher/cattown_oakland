As our Volunteer Coordinator, @lonecat79, enjoys a well deserved night's sleep, we want to congratulate him on completing his 24 hours walk around Lake Merritt! 
Jay works tirelessly every day to help Oakland's at-risk shelter cats find loving homes. He manages our incredible volunteers, and oversees day to day functions of Cat Town operations. But in the past two days, Jay has gone above and beyond, walking Lake Merritt from noon on Sunday (5/28) to noon today (5/29), all to bring awareness to the work we do at Cat Town. 
This is an amazing feat, but Jay is truly an amazing person with an incredible capacity to give. If you'd like to support Jay's efforts and Cat Town's mission, you can make a donation to our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser at bit.ly/cattownspc17 üêà
