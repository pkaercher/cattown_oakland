With just 48 hours to go, weâ€™re at 90% of our $60,000 fundraising goal, and in the running for a $10,000 bonus prize!

Donations up to $2,500 made by Thursday at 10:59AM PDT, the end of the Saving Pets Challenge, will be matched, thanks to @smartykatbrand & @petlinksbrand, as well as Cat Town staff and volunteers. Please donate today so we have the resources we need to help cats who need emergency medical care, like Wyatt here. 
Visit http://bit.ly/cattownspc17 to make a donation. Every dollar makes a difference!
