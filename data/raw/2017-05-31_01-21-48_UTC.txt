We have a winner! Congratulations Amanda, you've won a Caturday morning cartoon party in the Cat Zone for you and up to five friends! We'll be sending you an email shortly. 
We're in the final two days of our Saving Pets Challenge and are so close to securing not only a matching donation of $2,500, but also a bonus grant of $10,000 if we can place 5th over all! That means your donation can make an even greater impact for Oakland's at-risk shelter cats! 
Head on over to bit.ly/cattownspc17 to make a contribution of any size üêà
