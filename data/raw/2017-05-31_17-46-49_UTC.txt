We’re in the final 24 hours of our Saving Pets Challenge fundraiser, but our daily work continues. In a week, in a month, in a year, we’ll be at the shelter helping at-risk cats find a way out. We’re facing the problem head on, and you’re providing the solution through your donations. We’re doing this together as a community. 
Make a doubly impactful donation at bit.ly/cattownspc17 by 11AM PDT tomorrow (6/1) to give hundreds of Oakland shelter cats the second chance they deserve. A donation of any size will help! Thank you! 🐈
