FOSTERS URGENTLY NEEDED! Just yesterday, 24 cats entered the Oakland shelter, putting it at full capacity and cats who are not doing well there at risk. With our new adoption center just two weeks from being ready, even fostering until then would be a huge help. We will deliver the cat and all the supplies you need. Please contact info@cattownoakland.org if you can help, and share 🐈
