When 18-year-old Penny arrived at the Oakland shelter, she shut down and stopped eating so it was urgent to get her out. We were able to quickly get her into a foster home where she is now thriving. A donation before Saving Pets Challenge ends today at 11AM PDT means we'll be ready to save the next senior cat who needs us. 
We are SO CLOSE to securing a fifth place spot in the overall competition, which would earn us a bonus prize of $5,000! With that, you could double the impact of your donation! Even $10 makes a huge difference, so please, visit our fundraising page at bit.ly/cattownspc17 and help Oakland's at-risk shelter cats find their second chance through Cat Town üêà
