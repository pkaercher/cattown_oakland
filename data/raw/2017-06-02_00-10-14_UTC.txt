Thanks to you, our incredible supporters, we raised $67,559, including offline donations. That's 12% over our fundraising goal! Having the support of our community makes all the hard work not only easier, but doable. We can’t wait to bring you more stories of the Oakland cats you’re saving. And stay tuned for the grand opening of our newly expanded adoption center later this month, which will allow us to help even more of Oakland’s at-risk shelter cat population. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts 🐈
