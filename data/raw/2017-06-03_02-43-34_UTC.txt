Monkey is a confident 10-year-old torbie ready to find her home and family. She loves to be brushed and when she’s feeling active, will chase her ping pong ball up and down the hall. But most of the time she’s happy hanging out on the couch, enjoying her golden years. Monkey’s looking for cat competent adopters, but that could include mellow, older kids. Though she’s happy to share her space with her people, she’d prefer to be a solo cat and soak up all the pets for herself! Give her a little time to warm up and soon she’ll be your buddy!
