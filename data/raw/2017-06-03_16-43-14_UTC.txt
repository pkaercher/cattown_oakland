Can you foster for Charleston, Chanel, Duchess, or Herman? The shelter is at maximum capacity and we need to get these guys into foster homes as soon as possible. Even if you only have a short term space, please still reach out to see if there is a right fit. You can contact us at info@cattownoakland.org, and learn more about cats needing fosters online at www.cattownoakland.org/cats-needing-fosters 🐈
