Gilbert is ready to be adopted! His foster tells us that he “will curl up in any sort of nook you provide...under your arm if you're laying down, next to your hip if you’re standing near a table, anywhere he can get in a good cuddle." Gilbert lost his back leg due to a gunshot wound, but being a tripod has no affect on his loving personality or his love of play!
