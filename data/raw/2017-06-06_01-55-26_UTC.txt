Arthur is an affectionate 2-3 year old looking for a playmate! This Maine-Coon is still learning how to navigate the human world, especially when it comes to loud sounds, but is learning to trust more every day. His favorite way to learn - playtime with his string toy! You can read more about Arthur online at www.cattownoakland.org/arthur, and email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
