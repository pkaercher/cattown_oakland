Annabelle’s favorite spot is right at the top of the Tribune tower, where she can keep an eye on the entire Cat Zone, or more frequently, catch up on some beauty rest. She’s one of our cats looking for her future family. If you’re interested in adopting, you can see all our current cats online at http://www.cattownoakland.org/adopt, or email mailto:info@cattownoakland.org to learn more 🐈
