#tbt to when we met Grayson at the shelter a few months back. He was frightened and stressed, but showed us he was interested in humans, so we got him into our adoption center. And now, we’re happy to report that he’s found his family and goes home later today! If you’re looking to adopt, be sure to email info@cattownoakland.org for more information 🐈
