We've never seen Lorenzo so proud as he was posing for a recent portrait in the Cat Zone! He and his bonded partner, Vinnie, are on the hunt for their family. If you're looking to add a sweet bonded pair to your home, they could be your cats! Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more and set up a time to visit 🐈
