Photo of the week goes to volunteer, Nicole D, and this candid shot from her recent photoshoot with foster cat Milo. Our promotions team members, including photographers and biography writers, make it possible for us to get the message out about cats up for adoption! If you’re interested in volunteering with Cat Town, be sure to visit www.cattownoakland.org/volunteer 🐈
