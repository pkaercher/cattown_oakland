Reed (left) and Rowan may look nearly identical, but you'll learn their differences shortly after adopting! They're both fans of play and pets, but Rowan is more likely to lead the charge, with Reed getting in on the action when he's good and ready. You can learn more about the pair by visiting www.cattownoakland.org/rowan-and-reed, and email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
