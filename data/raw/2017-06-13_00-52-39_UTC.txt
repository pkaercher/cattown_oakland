When we met Charleston at the shelter he was completely shut down. Dealing with the stress of the cage, plus a skin condition, left him feeling defeated. But we just moved him into his new foster home, and in almost no time at all, he started nuzzling into pets. Getting cats out of the shelter gives them a chance to learn and show their true personalities without dealing with the stress of the cage. You can become a foster to a shelter cat in need.
