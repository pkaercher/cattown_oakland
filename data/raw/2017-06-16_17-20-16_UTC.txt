Anytime a cat bites someone at the shelter, even when everyone understands the cat was just scared, State law requires the cat be quarantined, without human interaction, for 10 days. Since that is an additional stress for the cat, it's our goal to get them to foster homes as soon as the quarantine period is up. In an odd coincidence, there are now 4 cats who have bit and need to get out. We have taken many a biter and have never regretted it, since it is a fear reaction. Can you provide a safe landing for one of these cats? 
Please email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about fostering, and if you can, share with your friends and family 🐈
