Can you guess which one of our Cat Zone tabbies has hidden her toes under her tail?! It's Annabelle! This playful, affectionate girl has made great strides during her time at Cat Town and will make a great companion cat. Email info@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in adopting her, or any of our available cats 🐈
