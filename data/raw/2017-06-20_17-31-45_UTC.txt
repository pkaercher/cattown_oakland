Looking for a cuddle buddy? Milo is your guy! His foster says Milo often falls asleep with his head on rested on his chest. And when he's up and about, he can be found exploring the house, or just happily purring away. We think Milo would do best as a solo cat, but just give him a little time to adjust in his new home and he'll be your BFF soon enough!
