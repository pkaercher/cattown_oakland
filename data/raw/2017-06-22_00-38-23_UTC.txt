Bianca’s foster calls her a “veritable snuggle monster”. This sweet and fluffy five-year-old is a great mix of affectionate and athletic. She has a knack for finding new and exciting ways to tackle her toys! She’ll need some time to adjust to new faces, but once she’s comfortable, she’ll fill your home with love and happiness.
