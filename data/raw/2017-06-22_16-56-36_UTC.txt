When people visit Cat Town, they might not know that we’re dedicated to helping cats who have the hardest time at the shelter. Gretchen here, is one of those cats, and she’s now learning what it’s like to interact with humans. Play has been a huge tool in helping build her confidence, so come down to 2869 Broadway today until 7PM and help change a life 🐈
