Have you heard about @meownge? It's the perfect combination of art meets cat rescue! This incredible 14' interactive sculpture is on it's way to Burning Man and is helping Cat Town in the process. As they raise funds to complete their project, the Meownge team will also be donating a portion to our rescue efforts.
