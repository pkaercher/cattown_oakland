FOSTER NEEDED! Aris is a sweet 7-year-old girl in need of a calm, quiet home. She's a strong, independent woman and she'll be sure to let you know when she wants pets and affection. We think she'd find a pet-free, kid-free home the most comfortable, and a foster with some cat experience would be the cherry on top! 
If you can, please share, and if you or someone you know can foster, please email info@cattownoakland.org as soon as possible üêà
