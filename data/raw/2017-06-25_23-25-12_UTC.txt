Sweet and playful Darcy is a force to be reckoned with - before you know it, she’ll have stolen your heart! When it’s time to play, she’s right there, ready to tackle her feather toy. When it’s time to relax she’ll purr up a storm, cradled in your arms. Darcy is FeLV positive, so she’ll need to be a solo cat, but with a warm, welcome space all her own, her loving personality will feel more like 10 cats than one.
