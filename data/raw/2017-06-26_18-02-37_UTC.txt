It’s Monday morning again, and Marie, our Cat Care Coordinator is hard at work helping some of our Cat Zone cats learn new tricks. If you’re interested in adopting, you can make a closed day appointment by emailing info@cattownoakland.org or plan to visit us when we reopen on Wednesday morning at 10AM at 2869 Broadway 🐈
