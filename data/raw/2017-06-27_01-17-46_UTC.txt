Are you kind, caring, and big-hearted? Have you been hoping to give back by taking in a foster cat? If you answered yes, we think Woolsey might be the foster cat for you. This senior boy is full of affection, and just loves being near his people. He'll need some help with his IBD, but has never had an incident outside the box. Now he's just looking for a special foster, or even better, an adopter, who can give him a loving home and a new best friend.
