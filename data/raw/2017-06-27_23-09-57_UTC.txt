We've been working so hard to bring our expanded adoption center to life and it's finally coming together, so much so that we've started moving cats into the spaces! One of our goals with the expansion was to give under socialized shelter kittens (what we call Forgotten Kittens) a safe place to build confidence with the help of our specially trained volunteers. These guys are just some of the first kittens we're helping, and will be up for adoption in the near future! We can't wait to unveil our new space and share more of our mission with you, our supporters 🐈
