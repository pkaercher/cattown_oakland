Snuggles and Lily are looking for a foster! This bonded boy and girl pair are very sweet, but Lily is feeling especially stressed by the shelter environment. We think she'll be much more comfortable once in a foster home. A calm, quiet, child-free space would best suit this pair. If you can foster, please email info@cattownoakland.org, and please share! 🐈
