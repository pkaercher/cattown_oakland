Sweet Alaska is still on the hunt for her family. She's built lots of confidence during her time in the Cat Zone and has become a big fan of pets and play. Now she's looking for a loving home with caring adopters and a feline friend! You can email info@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in adopting, or stop by 2869 Broadway to meet her 🐈
