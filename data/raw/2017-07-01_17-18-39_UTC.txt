SUPERHERO FOSTER NEEDED! Guy is a complicated but sweet cat. When we first met him at the shelter we couldn't get near him, but, as you can see in this video, he is interested in human interaction. Between being FIV+ and misunderstood, he's had a hard time at the shelter and it's time he got out. So if you're looking to make a big impact, please consider fostering Guy. You can email us at info@cattownoakland.org with and questions or inquiries 🐈
