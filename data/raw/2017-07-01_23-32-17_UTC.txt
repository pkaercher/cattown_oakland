Sweet Zoe is in need of a loving, caring, understanding human. She's had a tough life and is still a little unsure around humans, but enjoys the company of other cats and just needs a comfy space to call her own. Learn more about Zoe by visiting www.cattownoakland.org/zoe, and email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a visit 🐈
