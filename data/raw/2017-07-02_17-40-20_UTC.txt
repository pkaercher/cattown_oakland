Mr. Adorable is spending some time in our newly expanded adoption center. We think Mr. A might be in need of a home with access to safe, outdoor space, but we're taking a little time to learn more about him before deciding if he should go to a foster home or into the Cat Zone. This is just one of the ways our new adoption center will help change more lives for Oakland's shelter cats and we can't wait to share more with our supporters in the coming weeks! Stay tuned for our grand opening announcement 🐈
