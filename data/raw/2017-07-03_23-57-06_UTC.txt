We're looking for a new foster for sweet senior Shane. This guy is so easy to please, especially if you've got a running faucet! His very favorite activity is standing under the running water in the bath tub. He's friendly with new people and enjoys the company of his humans, but he's more than happy to occupy himself with a window view when on his own. If you're able to foster, or are interested in adopting, please email info@cattownoakland.org, and share with family and friends 🐈
