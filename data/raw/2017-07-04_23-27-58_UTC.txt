In his foster home, Arthur has revealed himself to be playful and affectionate. With super soft fur, he makes for a great cuddle buddy, but he's no stranger to playtime either. He loves chasing his ribbon toy all around the house! Arthur is still learning what it means to live with humans, and can sometimes startle around loud noises, so we're hoping to find him a calm, relaxed home with a loving human companion. If you or someone you know might want to adopt Arthur, please email us at info@cattownoakland.org, and learn more about Arthur online at www.cattownoakland.org/arthur üêà
