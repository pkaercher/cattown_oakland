URGENT FOSTER NEEDED! We're still on the hunt for a caregiver for sweet Guy. He's recently made some great progress at the shelter and we think once in a foster home, he'll continue to blossom. He's had a hard time dealing with the shelter stress so we'd like to get him moved ASAP. Please email info@cattownoakland.org if you or someone you know is able to foster, and please share if you can 🐈
