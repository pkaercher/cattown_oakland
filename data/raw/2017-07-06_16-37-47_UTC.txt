URGENT FOSTER NEEDED! Jenkins is having trouble getting along with his current feline roommate and we need to find him a new foster home in the next 5 days. For this reason, we'd like to get him into a comfortable, cat-free space. Given a little time to adjust to his new surroundings, he'll become a great companion! We'll provide all the supplies and support you'll need, so if you can foster, please email info@cattownoaklandland.org 🐈
