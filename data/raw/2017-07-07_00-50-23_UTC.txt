This afternoon we're spending some quality time with Woolsey in our new adoption center! This senior boy is an affectionate lap cat who loves pets and being with his people. At nearly 14-years-old, he will need an adopter willing to help with his IBD, but he's never had an accident outside the box, and he'll be sure to thank you for your help with all the lovin' you could want! Email info@cattownoakland.org to meet Woolsey, and read more about him online at www.cattownoakland.org/woolsey 🐈
