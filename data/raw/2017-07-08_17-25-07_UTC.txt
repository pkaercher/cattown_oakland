Ever since starting on their raw food diet from RAWR, Bishop and Bosley have been two happy campers! Their coats are incredibly soft, and we can't say it's the food for sure, but we think it might be what's causing the overload of cuteness in these two. Bishop and Bosley are available to meet in our newly expanded adoption center, and you can pick up RAWR cat food for your mini jungle cats next door at the RAWR Coffee Bar #eatlikealion 🐈🦁
