We're still on the hunt for a foster home for 7-year-old Aris. This confident, independent lady has been likened to Beyonce herself - she knows what she wants in life and isn't afraid to go get it! She'll be sure to let you know when she wants affection, but for the most part she's happy just being with her people. We think a kid-free, animal-free foster home will suit her needs best. Email us at info@cattownoakland.org if you or someone you know is able to foster 🐈
