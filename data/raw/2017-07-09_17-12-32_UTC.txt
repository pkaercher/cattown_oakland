Laid-back and super lovable, Miles is looking for a family to call his own. At 8-years-old, he's ready to retire and enjoy his golden years with a loving, affectionate family. His one ask is that you help motivate him during play time - he tends to prefer leisure to exercise and might need a little push to help him stay in shape. All in all, Miles is just an easy going guy looking for someone to love. Read Mile's bio online at www.cattownoakland.org/miles, and email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
