Our friends at @beerrevolution are hosting a pop-up event today, featuring @berryessabrewingco and tasty food from chef Navi Sohota (PINDU). Donations from the pop-up event will go toward helping us get more of Oakland's at-risk cats out of the shelter and into loving homes. So head down to Jack London Square for some good drinks, good food, and a good cause! We'll see you there until 6PM üêà
