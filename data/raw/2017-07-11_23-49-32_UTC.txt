UPDATE! We found a foster for Boots! Thank you to all who reached out and shared. There was such a response that we had to place interested parties on a wait list! Stay posted for future updates on his progress!

After living with his guardians his whole life, 23-year-old Boots was just brought to the Oakland shelter. He may have mouth cancer, and just a few months to live, but he is full of life now and we'll make sure his time left is filled with love and comfort. If you can foster or adopt Boots, we will provide any necessary supplies, veterinary care and loads of support. Please help this sweetheart of a cat!
If you or someone you know is able to foster or adopt, please reach out to us via info@cattownoakland.org, and please share if you can!
