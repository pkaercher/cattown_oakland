ATTN: POTENTIAL FOSTERS! We're looking for a new space for Billy and are hoping someone in the Cat Town community is the person to do it! Given a chance to adjust to a new space, Billy will reveal himself to be a laid-back guy with a passion for play and window perches! With a little extra love and patience, he'll soon be begging for pets and dropping toys at your feet. Interested in forming a special foster bond with Billy?
