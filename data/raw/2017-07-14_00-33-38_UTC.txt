For anyone who's been following Cat Town for a while, you might recognize Zoe as one of our long term foster cats who was in need or a special, understanding adopter to help her on her journey. Well we can't stop doing our happy dance because this week, Zoe's person came along! All the incredibly hard work she and her foster mom did has paid off, and now she's officially ADOPTED! Way to go, Zoe, we can't wait to see what your new life holds for you! üêà
