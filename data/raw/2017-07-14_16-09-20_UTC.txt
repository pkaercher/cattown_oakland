Warm and affectionate, Jura is on the hunt for her family! She has an easy time with new places and faces, and will happily snuggle up with you at the end of the day. She’s comfortable being on her own too, exploring the house and catching sun beams. Just keep an eye on her body language - she’ll tell you when she’s had her fill of pets!
