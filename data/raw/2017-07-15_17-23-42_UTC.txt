Bonded partners, Blizzard (white fur) and Yukon, are making lots of progress in their foster home. These two started off totally untouchable, but are learning to trust humans and even enjoy pets. They'll need an adopter with lots of patience and understanding to help them keep growing at their own pace. If you're that patient adopter, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
