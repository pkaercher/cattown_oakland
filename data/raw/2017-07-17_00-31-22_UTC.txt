Who's ready to foster?! Charelston has been doing great in his foster home, but he's outgrown his studio space. We're hoping to find him a foster home with a little more space to roam. If you have any questions, or are interested in being Charleston's foster, you can shoot us an email at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
