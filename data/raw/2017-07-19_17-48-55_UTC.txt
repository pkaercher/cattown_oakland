FOSTER NEEDED! 1-year-old brother and sister, Jack (B&W) and Tulip, are an active pair learning how to be around people. An ideal space would have a single room (with a window, if possible!) to get them started. It's possible the pair might be in need of a fospice home, though we're still waiting to see if they have FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis). We'll provide all the supplies, medical care, and support you'll need! Email us at info@cattownoakland.org with any questions about fostering üêà
