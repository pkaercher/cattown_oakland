#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Grayson was pretty shy when he first arrived at Cat Town, but made a lot of progress with the help of other confident cats and playtime. Now, in his home, his adopters tell us he continues to grow. He’s allowing some pets, exploring the house, and lounging to his heart’s content. You can give a cat like Grayson a great home, too!
