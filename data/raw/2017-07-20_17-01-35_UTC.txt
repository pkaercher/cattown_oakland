Bonded pair, Edie (left) and Patsy, are standing by, ready to greet our first guests of the day. Patsy may take the lead when it comes to confidence, but Edie's been coming out of her shell more and more, looking to cash in on pets! We're open today from 10AM to 7PM, so stop in for a coffee from the RAWR Coffee Bar (@eatlikealion), and get to know our 19 adoptable cats! 🐈
