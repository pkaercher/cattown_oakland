Though you may first notice her stunning good looks, Chanel has so much more to offer! When she’s spending time with her people, she’ll purr up a storm to tell you how happy she is. Just be sure to watch her body language for signs of overstimulation during pets and playtime. Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting in her foster home 🐈
