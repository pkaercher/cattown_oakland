Cat Town community, we're looking to you to help us get Clyde, Andre, and Blanket out of the shelter. Clyde is most in need of a home as he's feeling very stressed by the environment, but we'd love to get all three moved as soon as possible! Do you have a spare room? Or know someone with a home office? Email us at info@cattownoakland.org to talk about fostering. We'll provide all the supplies, medical care, and support you need!
