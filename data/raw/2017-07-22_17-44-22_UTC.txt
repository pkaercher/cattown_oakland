Some people like to adopt kittens, some people like to adopt seniors, and some people like to adopt confident middle age female cats who know what they want in life! If you fall into that last category, Aris might just be your girl! She's an independent lady who likes pets and affection, and will be sure to let you know when she'd like them. Interested in meeting Aris? Email us at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
