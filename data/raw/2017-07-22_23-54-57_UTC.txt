ADOPTED! Rowan and Reed had been waiting for their family to come along and this past week they did! We couldn't be happier for these sweet brothers and their adopters! Interested in becoming a Cat Town family? See all our current cats online at www.cattownoakland.org/adopt, and email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting 🐈
