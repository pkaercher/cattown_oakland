Cameron, or Cam as he’s known to his friends, is growing in his foster home every day! This fluffy boy is making lots of progress, especially thanks to play - wand toys are his very favorite! Now all he needs is an adopter ready to give him a loving home and time to blossom. Email us at info@cattownoakland.org if you’re interested in meeting Cam 🐈
