Gentle giant, Andre, is looking for a foster. This sweet 10-year-old is likely diabetic and will need someone who can administer insulin shots. But with his easy going-demeanor and relaxed attitude it should be no trouble at all. If you haven't given shots before, we'd be more than happy to show you how! Because he's declawed, Andre will need to be an indoor only cat, but he loves to be brushed and spending time with his people is his most favorite activity. Email us at info@cattownoakland.org if you're able to foster Andre, the (gentle) giant! üêà
