Howdy, Ranger! This one-year-old Siamese has been building confidence over the past few months and has made a lot of excellent progress! We think he'd be happiest in a home with another confident feline companion and a patient, understanding adopter, who can give him the time he needs to adjust. If that sounds like you, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to talk more about adopting 🐈
