Wide-eyed and affectionate, sweet Winnie is ready to find her home! This lovely lady is making lots of progress with the help of her fosters, and now she's looking to build a long lasting and loving relationship with her future adopter. Just give her a few safe spaces to tuck away when she's feeling shy and you'll have her trust in no time! Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting with Winnie 🐈
