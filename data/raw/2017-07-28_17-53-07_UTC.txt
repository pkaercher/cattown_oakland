Milo is the kind of cat who just loves to be with his people! He's playful and affectionate and will just be happy being near by. A smile always comes across our faces when we remember that Milo often falls asleep with his head resting on his foster's chest! As Milo gets used to his new home, he'll take a little time scoping things out, but will be so excited to love and be loved! Interested in adopting? Email us at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
