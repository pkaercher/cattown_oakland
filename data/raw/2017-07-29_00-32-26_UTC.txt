Interested in fostering? Well you're in luck because Charleston is a great cat looking for a foster! He's been doing so well in his current space, but he's outgrown his studio apartment and is looking for something with a little more room to play. He is the sweetest boy and fostering him will mean lots of affection and entertainment. You can email us at info@cattownoakland.org to learn more 🐈
