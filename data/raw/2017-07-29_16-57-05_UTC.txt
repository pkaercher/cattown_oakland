Angel, Adrian, and Jordan are sweet, playful, and now up for adoption! You can meet them when you visit us at 2869 Broadway. Just ask one of our adoption counselors to show you to their studio in our newly expanded adoption center. Or feel free to email us at info@cattownoakland.org with any adoption questions! üêà
