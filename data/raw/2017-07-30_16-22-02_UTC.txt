What an incredible week for 10-year-old Andre! When we brought him from the shelter last Saturday, we thought he was likely diabetic, but learned on Tuesday that his tests came back negative! And now, we're ecstatic to report that this incredibly sweet boy was adopted on Thursday after just 6 days at Cat Town! We all grew so attached to Andre in such a short amount of time, but know that he'll be equally loved by his new family! Enjoy your first #SeniorCatSunday at home, Andre! 🐈
