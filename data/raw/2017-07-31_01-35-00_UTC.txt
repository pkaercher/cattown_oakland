When our cats make their way to a foster home, we often watch their personalities unfold over many months. What we've learned so far about Summer is that she's affectionate, she loves comfy spaces, and isn't a fan of loud noises. We're thinking a big-hearted adopter, ready to make an impact in the life of a blossoming cat would suit Summer perfectly! She'd also love to go to a home with a feline companion. You can email us at info@cattownoakland.org to learn more and set up a meeting 🐈
