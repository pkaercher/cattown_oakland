FOSTER NEEDED! Clyde's been feeling very stressed in the shelter cage and could really use a comfortable foster home. In his previous home, he was known to enjoy hanging out on the couch with his people and we hope getting him out of the cage will get him feeling normal again. We hope to find him a kid-free home with an experienced guardian. Please email us at info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about fostering 🐈
