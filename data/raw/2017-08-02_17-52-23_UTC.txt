#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Copper (FKA Sam) and Spock (FKA Victor) are both Cat Town alum, but didn't come to us bonded, or even at the same time. But volunteer, John H., saw the potential for friendship, and they have become inseparable in their home! They play together, nap together, even give each other baths! It's incredibly cute, and we couldn't be happier that the pair ended up together! Have you adopted a Cat Town cat? Be sure to use #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday when posting, so we can follow along on their adventures 🐈
