It's #FosterFriday and we're shining a light on the beautiful and affectionate, Carmelita! No, you don't have to have a carpet that matches her eyes to adopt her, all you have to have is a big heart and a desire for a new best friend. Because Carmelita is declawed, she should be an indoor only cat in a calm, quiet home. Ready to bring Carmelita home? Email us at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
