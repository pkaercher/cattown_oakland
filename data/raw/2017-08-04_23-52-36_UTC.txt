Hattie's been stealing lots of hearts during her time in the Cat Zone, but now she's stollen one and won't give it back! That's right, Hattie's been adopted! We're so excited to send this little lady on her way. We've had lots of adoptions in the past few weeks, and our Cat Zone population is on the lower side, so if you're interested in adopting, be sure to visit cattownoakland.org/adopt to see our current foster, Cat Zone, and Adoption Center cats! 🐈
