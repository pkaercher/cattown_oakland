We're declaring today #DaisyMaeSaturday! This sweetheart has made incredible progress during her time at Cat Town! When she arrived from @feralchange we couldn't get near her, and pets were a definite no. But now, she's our most confident Cat Zone cat, playing and relaxing out in the open, and even accepting pets! We think today has to be the day she gets adopted! Meet Daisy Mae at 2869 Broadway from 10AM to 7PM, or email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting 🐈
