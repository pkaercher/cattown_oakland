It's #SeniorCatSunday and Frankie is ready to find his people! He's a 15-year-old incredibly easy-going guy who loves pets. When you get home for the day he'll greet you at the door with welcoming mews. Seniors make incredible companions and Frankie is the cream of the crop! Email us at info@cattownoakland.org to inquire about adopting 🐈
