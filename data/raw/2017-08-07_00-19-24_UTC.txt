Helping senior cats find loving homes is a huge part of the Cat Town mission. When seniors end up at the shelter, the experience can be very stressful, but getting them into foster homes or studio spaces at our Adoption Center gives them a chance to find comfort again. Charlotte is one of our current seniors in a foster home and she's looking for her family! Learn more about her online at cattownoakland.org/charlotte and email info@cattownoakland.org to adopt #SeniorCatSunday 🐈
