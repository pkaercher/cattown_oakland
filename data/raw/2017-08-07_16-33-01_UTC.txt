Congratulations, Roxanne, you found your family! This sweet seven-month-old only spent a few weeks in the Cat Zone before being adopted. Now she'll get to keep growing her confidence in her new home! We're closed today and tomorrow, but if you'd like to adopt, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to set up a visit any day of the week 🐈
