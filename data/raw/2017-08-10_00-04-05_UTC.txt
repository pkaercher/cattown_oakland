Happy Enzo, hanging with his people! This little foster kitty is looking for a companion who will let him snuggle and play to his heart's content. His foster describes him as a "goofball", and a total purr machine. As long as he can have a little time to adjust to his new space, he'll be the happiest cat on the block soon enough!
