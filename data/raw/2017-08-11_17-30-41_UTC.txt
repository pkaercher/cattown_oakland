The first ever Kitten Wire is live on our blog! Week to week, Forgotten Kitten Project Manager, Ginny L., will be chronicling the progress of our youngest Cat Town residents and their journey to socialization and adoption. In her first installment, she explains the Forgotten Kitten Project and Cat Town's mission to change what's possible for older shelter kittens. Get the full story at bit.ly/kittenwireintro, and check back each week on #ForgottenKittenFridays for more updates 🐈
