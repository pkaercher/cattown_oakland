It's the first day of our black cat adoption special and it also happens to be #SeniorCatSunday! What better way to celebrate the occasion than by adopting Bastille?! This beautiful girl is just on the cusp of her senior citizenship at 7-years-old. Getting her out of the shelter changed her life - she went from shut down and sick to affectionate and healthy. Now all she needs is a family of her own! Please email info@cattownoakland.org to inquire about adopting 🐈
