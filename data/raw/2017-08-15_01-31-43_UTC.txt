Don't be fooled, this isn't a photo of a panther in the wild. It's just foster cat Jura showing off her hunting skills! This lovable lady is a great companion. She makes friends easily and loves affection, but she's just as happy being independent and exploring on her own. You can learn more about Jura online at www.cattownoakland.org/jura and adopt her during our black cat adoption week! Email us at info@cattownoakland.org to learn more 🐈
