Everyone who meets Darcy says the same thing: "She's so sweet!" Darcy really is a charmer, nuzzling her head into your hand for pets and dancing around your lap when you sit on the floor. Darcy is FeLV+, and should be an indoor and solo cat. She's currently residing in one of our Studio spaces at Cat Town, open to the public during regular hours. Can't wait until we open to adopt this sweet girl? Email us at info@cattownoakland.org to set up an appointment. Now is the perfect time to adopt Darcy during our Black Cat Adoption Special üêà
