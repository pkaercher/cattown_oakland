Mama Mia, what a cutie! At 8-months-old, Mia is a playful, fun loving little lady. She's only been at Cat Town for a little over a week, but has charmed every single person she's met. She's feeling so ready to be adopted and it would be extra special if she went home on Black Cat Appreciation Day! Maybe she'll go home with you! Stop by and meet her until 7PM today or email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more 🐈
