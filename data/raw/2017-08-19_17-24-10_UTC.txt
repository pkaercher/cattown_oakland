Mr. Adorable is no stranger to the lime light. Even though he's a laid-back guy, he tends to find himself at the center of attention with our visitors - and he loves it! He can't resist a lap and loves nothing more than soaking up pets. This sweet boy is FIV+, and should be an indoor only cat, but will surely fill your home with lots of love and affection. And shoutout to @eatlikealion for helping him get that panther like coat! Come visit him today until 7PM at 2869 Broadway, and adopt him as part of our Black Cat Adoption Special 🐈
