In the final hours of our Black Cat Adoption Special we wanted to tell you about foster cat, Billy. Billy has worked so hard in the care of his fosters, learning that humans can be trusted with time and patience. We're hoping a kind and understanding adopter is out there right now, looking for Billy! It could even be you! Read Billy's full bio at www.cattownoakland.org/billy and be sure to email us at info@cattownoakland.org to learn about adopting 🐈
