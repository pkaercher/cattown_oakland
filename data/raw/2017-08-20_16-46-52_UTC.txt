Guy has become a total staff and volunteer favorite during his time in our studios! We've been working with him to figure out what kind of space and family will suit him best. Someone who is patient and knows cat body language would be the ideal companion. And a space where Guy can play and receive lots and lots of pets is a must! if you think you might be the patient, loving adopter Guy is looking for, email us at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
