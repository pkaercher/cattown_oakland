We have a bunch of adoption updates to share but we'll start with a Cat Zone favorite, Mr. Adorable! A lovely mom and daughter pair had fallen in love with Mr. A online and came in yesterday to meet him! And that was all it took! Now he's on his way to happily ever after. Our staff and volunteers had come to love Mr. A so much and were sad to say goodbye, but we're also so happy he was able to find his family through Cat Town! If you'd like to support our mission to give Oakland's at-risk shelter cats a chance to find loving homes, please consider making a donation at www.cattownoakland.org/donate üêà
