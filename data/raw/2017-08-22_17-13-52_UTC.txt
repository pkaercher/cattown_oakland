Introducing the easy-going and affectionate Simone! After mothering a litter of kittens, she's ready to settle into a life of love and comfort. Her foster tells us that she enjoys spending time with her people or just sitting by the window, watching cars go by. And at just 8-months-old, she's still got lots of playful energy in her. Simone does have a little bit of that classic toritude, so we recommend keeping an eye on her body language - she'll be sure to tell you what she wants.
