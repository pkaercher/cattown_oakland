Big adoption news! It's been a long time coming, but Daisy Mae has finally found her family! Her love of sunbathing was really the key factor - her adopters fell in love when they saw her in the window at Cat Town. We could not be prouder of all the progress Daisy Mae made during her time with us and we can't wait to watch her blossom in her new home 🐈
