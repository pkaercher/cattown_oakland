#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Sophia was a total pistol when she arrived at Cat Town in 2016. Her feisty spirit had her foster parents hooked, and they made it official last July. Now, a little more than a year later, Sophia is living a life of adventure, exploring the great outdoors and seeing the wonders of the West Coast! You can follow her adventures @the_feisty_sophia, and be sure to tag your Cat Town alum photos on #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday 🐈
