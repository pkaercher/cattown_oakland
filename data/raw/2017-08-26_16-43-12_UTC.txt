Star (left) and Kelda are frequently found cuddling together, and with other cats, in the Quiet Zone. They're each on the lookout for their families, but who knows, maybe they'll find someone who will adopt them as a pair! Whatever kind of cat you're looking for, we can help you find your match. Email info@cattownoakland.org to inquire about adopting and meet all our cats today from 10AM to 7PM at 2869 Broadway 🐈
