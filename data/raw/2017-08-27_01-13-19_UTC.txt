Celebrate #ShelterCatSaturday by becoming a foster parent to a shelter cat in need. We're looking for fosters for Charlie and Nena (swipe to see her photo). Both are sweet cats with some medical challenges, but will make great companions. We provide all the supplies and support and you provide the love! Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about fostering 🐈
