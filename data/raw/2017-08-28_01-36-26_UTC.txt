Introducing Tangerine, now available for adoption! She’s sweet, affectionate, and playful! Be prepared to feel totally loved when you make it home because Tangerine is a one woman welcome wagon. Her fosters tell us that she’s friendly with new people and she loves playtime (photo evidence attached). Ready to bring Tangerine home? Email info@cattownoakland.org to make it happen 🐈
