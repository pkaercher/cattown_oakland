Lucinda has really revealed her loving personality over the past week and we think whoever adopts her will be very lucky! We're closed to the public today and tomorrow, but potential adopters are welcome to email info@cattownoakland.org to schedule an appointment for any day of the week! Lucinda sure would love to meet you 🐈
