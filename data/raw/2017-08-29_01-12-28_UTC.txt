When his family moved, Milo was brought to the Oakland shelter where he might have been mistaken for a feral cat, hissing and swatting at anyone who approached his cage. Many cats like Milo can't cope with the unfamiliarity of a shelter, but we knew that time in a foster home would allow Milo to feel safe and be himself again. Sure enough, on his first day in foster-care, Milo was nuzzling into pets and begging for affection - a change of environment was all it took! Now he's ready to find his family!
