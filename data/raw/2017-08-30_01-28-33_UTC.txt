Eira and Islyn are just the cutest little pair. At 5-months-old, they are huge fans of play, and while Islyn tends to be the more outgoing of the two, both love affection and pets. They really are the full kitten package! Interested in adopting this sweet sister pair? Email info@cattownoakland.org or drop in for a visit when we open our doors tomorrow morning at 10AM 🐈
