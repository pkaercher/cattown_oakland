URGENT FOSTER NEEDED: Sasha is a sweet, affectionate girl who is feeling super stressed by the cage and hasn't eaten since arriving. If we can get her out of the shelter and into a foster home, we think she'll feel a lot more comfortable and get back to normal. If you or someone you know can foster Sasha, please email info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
