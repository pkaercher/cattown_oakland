On the first day of our foster cat adoption special we're bringing you this #fosterfriday progress report on super senior cat, Bailey. He's been working so hard to regain some use of his back legs and it's starting to pay off! Just look at him go! We could not be prouder of him, or more grateful to his foster family for all the love and care provided along the way. 
Bailey is just the sweetest cat, and while he may have some medical challenges, he never lets it dampen his incredibly sweet disposition. If you'd like to talk about adopting Bailey, email info@cattownoakland.org, and read more about him at www.cattownoakland.org/bailey
