Now up for adoption: foster cat, Captain! This guy is a total charmer and proves that three legs are just as good as four! He'll be so excited to meet you at the door when you make it home - all his favorite things are just more fun with his people. Ready to take Captain home? Email info@cattownoakland.org. All foster cat adoption fees are just $15 for qualified applicants through Monday 9/4 🐈
