Charlie is a total sweetheart on the lookout for a foster. He'll need some dental care in the coming weeks and as an FIV+ cat he'll need an indoor only space. But there is no doubt he'll be sure to say thank you with lots of love and affection. Email info@cattownoakland.org if you're able to foster Charlie, or pass the word along if you know anyone who's right for the job 🐈
