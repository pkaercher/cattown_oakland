There is no better way to celebrate #SeniorCatSunday during our foster cat adoption special than by adopting a senior! At 14-years-old, Einstein may technically qualify, but he wanted us to tell potential adopters that he doesn't feel a day over 7. He's full of love and affection and cannot wait to meet his future family! Could it be you? Email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting 🐈
