Seniors often have a hard time getting adopted from the shelter, and the stress of the environment can take a toll on their health. That's why it's so important we work to find senior cats, like Gemma here, the loving homes they deserve. When you adopt a senior, you get a loving companion and one who usually enjoys a pretty laid-back lifestyle. Gemma is an easy going girl, who loves affection! Ready to adopt, email info@cattownoakland.org. Foster cat adoption fees are just $15 through tomorrow üêà
