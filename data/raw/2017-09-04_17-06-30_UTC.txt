While today may be Labor Day, we're declaring it Trevor Day! Trevor is a very special Cat Town cat. It took him a while to feel comfortable in his foster home, but once he did, his personality showed up in full force! Trevor is incredibly affectionate and loves nothing more than being by his foster's side. Because Trevor is so special, we're looking for an equally special person, who is willing to let him blossom at him own pace, knowing devoted companionship is waiting on the other side. We'll be sharing more about Trevor in our Instagram story all day, but if you think you are Trevor's human, or know someone who is, be sure to email info@cattownoakland.org. $15 foster cat adoption fees end today üêà
