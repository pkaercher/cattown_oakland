Valentino and Nefertiti recently made their way to Cat Town after their owner passed away. At 11-years-old, losing the only home they've ever known, and their lifetime human companion, has been a stressful experience, and we'd love to find them their new family ASAP. The pair are part of our In It For Life program, where vet bills will be covered by Cat Town for the rest of their golden years. They are incredibly sweet and just need a loving human who can give them the gift of home. Please email us at info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting 🐈
