Anyone who's stopped into Cat Town recently has probably spent some time petting Star in the Quiet Zone. This sweet girl has really built up her confidence over the past few months and we think her family has to be just around the corner. Ready to meet Star? Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a time to visit or stop in at 2869 Broadway today until 7PM 🐈
