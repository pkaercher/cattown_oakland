Last week we shared the story of a shelter cat named Sasha who was so stressed she wasn't eating. Another cat (Queen Floofs, pictured here) arrived at the shelter at the same time, but it wasn't clear they'd come in together. Fortunately, a shelter volunteer figured out they were a pair, and we were able to reunite them, reinvigorating Sasha's appetite! Now it's time for Floofs and Sasha to find their home! Email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting or visit us at 2869 Broadway today until 7PM 🐈
