Foster Needed: Sweet Nadine has been doing great in her current foster home, but the resident cat is looking to get back to the only child lifestyle, so we'd like to find a new foster ASAP. Nadine is a very loving and affectionate cat who would benefit from a calm environment and a patient foster who can see her sweet nature through her shy exterior. Please email us at info@cattownoakland.org to talk about fostering and learn more about this sweet girl online at cattownoakland.org/nadine
