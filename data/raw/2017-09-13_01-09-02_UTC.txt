Two more of our Forgotten Kitten Project grads, sisters Aspen and Leaf, made their way home this past weekend and we could not be more excited for them and their new family! If you're feeling inspired by the work we're doing with our Forgotten Kitten Project, we hope you'll consider making just a $10 donation at cattownoakland.org/donate to help us continue our life-saving work 🐈
