#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Georgie was adopted from Cat Town back in September of 2014. She, like many Cat Town cats, started out shy in her new home. But her adopter tells us, "Now, 3 years later, she is one of the most loyal animals I've ever known. She always greets me with meows and flops the second I walk in the door. She sits on strangers' laps, and she sleeps right at my feet every night. To think that this was the same cat who wouldn't let a human touch her! I am forever grateful to Cat Town for matching me with my feline soul mate." That's why we always say love + time = magic! See our current adoptable cats at cattownoakland.org/adopt üêà
