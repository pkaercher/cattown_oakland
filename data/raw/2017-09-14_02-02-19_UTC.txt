Now up for adoption: Marcella! Full of confidence and affection, this girl is a tiny wonder to be seen! Though she's already 2-years-old, she's got a playful spirit much like a kitten. We think she'll feel right at home with a patient, loving adopter willing to make her health a priority. Don't worry, though, Marcella's eyes have never slowed her down! She's even friendly with dogs and other, confident cats! Ready to make Marcella the newest member of your family? Email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting üêà
