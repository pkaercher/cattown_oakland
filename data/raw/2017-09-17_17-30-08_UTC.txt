We're getting all teary-eyed on this #SeniorCatSunday watching Bailey's incredible progress! This sweet senior came to us without any use of his back legs, but now, thanks to the dedication of his foster parents, Bailey is walking, sometimes even trotting, like a champ! Bailey is just the kindest cat and wants nothing but to be with his people. If you're the family Bailey's been looking for, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting 🐈
