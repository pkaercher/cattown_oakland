Brothers, Mango (orange tabby) and Morgan (tabby) went home with their new family last week - another pair of Forgotten Kittens graduated and onto the good life! We were just looking back at some photos from their time at the shelter (swipe to see) and couldn't help but think about the next group of kittens we'll be bringing to Cat Town this week. With your support, we'll keep finding homes for vulnerable shelter kittens. Thank you for all you make possible, and if you'd like to support our work with a $5-10 donation, please visit cattownoakland.org/donate üêà
