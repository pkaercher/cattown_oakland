Big thank you to Nancy, who's now donated three batches of these perfect little cat blankets! They are the perfect size for our felines! If you are ever interested in donating something to Cat Town, please be sure to email us at info@cattownoakland.org. That way we can let you know if we, or one of our rescue partners, can put your items to good use 🐈
