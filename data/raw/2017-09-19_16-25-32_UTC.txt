Foster needed! Wyatt has stolen the heart of everyone he's met,. Everyone, that is, except the resident cat in his current foster home. That's why we're looking for a new space for the little guy. He loves to play and is super affectionate, often bumping your hand with his head to initiate pets. If you're able to foster this sweetheart, please email us at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
