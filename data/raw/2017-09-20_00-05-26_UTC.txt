We have some incredible volunteers helping Oakland's vulnerable shelter cats make it out of the cage and into loving homes. This month, we're celebrating volunteer, Jacqui R., who does so much for Cat Town, including fostering cats with ringworm. Read her full interview up on the blog (bit.ly/volunteerofthemonthjacquir), and be sure to email info@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in fostering 🐈
