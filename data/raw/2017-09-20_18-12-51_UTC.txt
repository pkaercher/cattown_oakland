It's a busy time of year for rescues and shelters, and it's no different here at Cat Town. This week we've got 23 great cats in our Cat Zone space and we are so excited to help them find their families! Today (9/20) through Sunday (9/24) Cat Zone adoption fees will be just $20 for qualified applicants. Cats like Diana here just can't wait to meet you! Feel free to email us with any inquiries at info@cattownoakland.org or visit us at 2869 Broadway here in Oakland 🐈
