Kelda, one of our older forgotten kittens, has made so much progress the past few weeks. She spent a few months building confidence in the Quiet Zone, but has recently been spending her days out in the open, playing with our guests and even accepting some pets. Since she's learned so much from watching our other Cat Zone residents, we'd like to find her a home with another cat buddy. Come meet this sweet girl today from 10AM to 7PM at 2869 Broadway. Adoption fees are just $20 through this Sunday for qualified adopters 🐈
