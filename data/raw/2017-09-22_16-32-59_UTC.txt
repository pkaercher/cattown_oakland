It’s #ForgottenKittenFriday and that means we’ve got another edition of the Kitten Wire up on the blog. This week, FKP Manager Ginny shares a gallery of our recently adopted kittens and the importance of the phrase “goodbye is the goal”. Check it out at bit.ly/fkpadoptions and ask about our current kittens up for adoption by emailing info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
