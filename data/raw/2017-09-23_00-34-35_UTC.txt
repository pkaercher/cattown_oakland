We can't say we're surprised that Trixie spent only a couple days in the Cat Zone before being adopted. This sweet girl made lots of progress in her foster home before making her way to the Cat Zone this past week. What better way to celebrate #ForgottenKittenFriday than by being adopted! We'll be open until 7PM. Stop in to meet all our other adoptable cats, waiting for their perfect match 🐈
