Join us this coming Sunday for the official grand opening of our expanded adoption center #thankstomaddie! We’ve been inviting guests into the Studios at Cat Town for a couple months now, but we’re making it official with waived entry fees and waived adoption fees. Plus, you’ll have chances to name future Cat Town cats! We look forward to seeing you at 2869 Broadway from 10AM to 5PM 🐈
