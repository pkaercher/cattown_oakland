Who's ready to foster?! We've got two sweet girls looking for new spaces. Chanel (all white fur) is an affectionate 2-year-old with a love of play! Nadine (tabby) is also a sweetheart who happens to be a little shyer, but is still looking for a foster who can offer up lots of pets! If you are able to foster please email info@cattownoakland.org, or if you know someone right for the job, tag them below or send them our way. We provide all the supplies, medical care and support needed üêà
