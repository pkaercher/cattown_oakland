#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: When Mr. Adorable arrived at Cat Town he was desperate for affection, but wasn't sure how to interact with people. It took him a few months, but he learned how to get the love he craved without getting over excited. Now, a little over a month after his adoption, Mr. A  is living the life with with his new family. He even has his own Instagram @mister_adorable! We love seeing updates on our Cat Town alum, so be sure to tag us when posting 🐈
