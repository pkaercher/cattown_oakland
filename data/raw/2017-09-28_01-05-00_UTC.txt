Nap time! Copper is a friendly, easy-going, orange tabby girl (rare, we know!) looking for the family of her dreams. She loves meeting new people but would prefer a home where she is the only cat greeting you at the front door. Ready to bring Copper home? Email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting 🐈
