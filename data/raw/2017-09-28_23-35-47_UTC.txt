#tbt to meeting Hilo, Waikiki, Lanai, Kona, and Oahu at the shelter a few months back. Once terrified of humans, these kittens are now play machines and are even enjoying pets! They'll be featured in tomorrow's edition of the Kitten Wire and will soon be looking for families all their own. We'll be sure to let you know when they're available for adoption 🐈
