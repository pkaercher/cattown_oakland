Cats can't drink coffee, but you can drink coffee with cats! It's #InternationalCoffeeDay and we may be biased, but we think the best way to enjoy a hot java is in the company of a feline friend. Grab a drink from the RAWR Coffee Bar (@eatlikealion) and come meet our 17 adoptable cats today until 7PM at 2869 Braodway! And don't forget to check out all the sweet coffee cat swag in the RAWR gift shop üêà
