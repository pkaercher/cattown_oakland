Thank you to all who helped spread the word about Chanel - she has found a new foster! We're hoping you, or someone you know, might also be able to help Nadine. The resident cat in Nadine's current space is missing the only cat life, so we'd like to move her somewhere ASAP. She's super sweet and loves pets! Email us at info@cattownoakland.org for more information 🐈
