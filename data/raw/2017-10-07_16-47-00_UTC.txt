This #ShelterCatSaturday we're looking back to when we first met Penelope. Initially she seemed pretty shy, but she just needed someone to look past her shelter stress and get to know the real cat. Now out of the cage, she's living it up in her foster home! You can help other stressed shelter cat like Penelope. If you're interested in fostering or adopting, please email info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
