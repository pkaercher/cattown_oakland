Our dear friends at @jamesonanimalrescueranch may need help evacuating the cats at their cat cafe in Napa. We are on stand by to help, but don't yet have all the details. In the event there is an urgent need to get these cats to safety, please email info@cattownoakland.org to let us know if you can be at the ready to help. And if you don't live in the Bay Area, but know someone who does, please share 🐈
