#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: After a stressful start at the shelter, Guy made his way to Cat Town. He was so eager for affection that his excitement sometimes turned to aggression. But with time, he learned how to interact with humans and get the love he so desperately craved. Now he's living large in his adoptive home with his new mom and feline sibling. You can follow his happily ever after adventures @claytonpurrshaw and be sure to use the hashtag #cattownalum when posting updates on your Cat Town cat 🐈
