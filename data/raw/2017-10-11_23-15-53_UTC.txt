To be of most help during this tragic time, we‚Äôre working closely with our partners at @oaklandanimalservices to make room for displaced cats from neighboring fires. If you can foster for Cat Town to help create more space at the shelter please let us know. Additionally, the best way to help is to adopt, from us or any rescue organization in the Bay Area, opening up space for evacuated NorCal cats. Effective immediately we‚Äôll be waiving adoption fees and encourage adopters to instead donate to a charity aiding in fire relief efforts. If you have any questions, please email info@cattownoakland.org üêà
