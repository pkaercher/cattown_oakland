Bringing more families together is our favorite thing! With the opening of our new adoption studios, 63 of our cats found homes in August and September vs. 48 cats last year. See the full September adoption gallery on our blog at bit.ly/cattownseptemberadoptions and email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about bringing home a feline friend 🐈
