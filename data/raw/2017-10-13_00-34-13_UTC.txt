Please welcome to the team, Skeeter! This purr machine will start revving the second he gets pets, and when he's on his own, he's just as happy playing the day away. He's a great candidate for any family, just promise him a few treats now and then and he'll be your best friend! Email info@cattownoakland.org to inquire about adopting Skeeter 🐈
