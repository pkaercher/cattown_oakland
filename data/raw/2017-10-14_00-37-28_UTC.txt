How do you turn Friday the 13th into your lucky day? By adopting a cat, of course! Since October is Black Cat Awareness Month and Halloween month, we'll be giving one of these lovely, handmade candy corn toys by @pieboxdolls to every black cat who gets adopted! Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a time to meet your new best friend 🐈
