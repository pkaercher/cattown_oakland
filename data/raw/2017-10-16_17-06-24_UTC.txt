@fix_our_ferals is an incredible organization performing low-cost spay/neuter surgeries for the East Bay. We regularly depend on them here at Cat Town! They also do a great deal to help reduce the feral and stray cat overpopulation issue through their Trap-Neuter-Return work. We hope that in celebration of #NationalFeralCatDay you'll consider making a donation to their organization. To learn more, visit fixourferals.org 🐈
