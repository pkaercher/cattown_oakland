Zazzles recently came to Cat Town as part of our effort to help make room at @oaklandanimalservices for cats displaced by the fires to the north. We had no idea that he'd be adopted the same day he arrived! For every cat adopted, we can empty another shelter cage. If you're ready to adopt, email info@cattownoakland.org. Fees are currently waived so it's the perfect time to expand your family 🐈
