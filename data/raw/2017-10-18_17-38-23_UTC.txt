#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: We had to share this recent update from Darius and Morgan's adopter - "Zinn (b&w) and Kiefer (formerly Darius and Morgan) are doing great. They are extremely well adjusted to life with two little kids, and we are so grateful that they have joined our family and fill our days with their antics. We couldn't have asked for better kitties...Thank you for giving these two another chance!" Don't forget to share your updates by tagging #CatTownAlum 🐈
