As a cat with feline Leukemia, its hard to know what Darcy's life expectancy will be, but she is so deserving of a loving home for as long as she has. That's why we're so excited to announce she's been adopted, and during Black Cat Awareness month to boot! Darcy's adopter truly is a hero, and you can be too!
