Thank you to all who've helped us make room at the shelter for cats displaced by the North Bay fires. Cosmo here recently went to a foster home, emptying a shelter cage for a cat in need. We are in awe of your generosity and can't thank you enough for spreading the word and volunteering. If you'd like to help by adopting, please email info@cattownoakland.org. Our fees are currently waived to help make room for more cats, and adopters are encouraged to instead make a donation to fire relief efforts 🐈
