In the three years since opening our doors at 2869 Broadway, we've been able to help hundreds of cats find the loving homes they deserve, including Edie and Patsy here. So on our third anniversary, we want to celebrate you, the community that makes out work possible. Thank you! If you'd like to visit Cat Town today, reservations can be made online at cattownoakland.org/reservations 🐈
