Over the past few months, we've been helping a litter of kittens heal from a skin condition and socialize in our expanded adoption center. Last week, they were given a clean bill of health, and before we could blink, they were adopted; Soju and Mandoo as one pair, Kimchi and Bulgogi as the other. Another happy ending on the books! Email info@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in adopting through our Forgotten Kitten Project.
