Our friend and Cat Town family member, @catmanofwestoakland, has pulled together another awesome Hoodcats calendar for 2018. Proceeds go to @feralchange and the amazing work they're doing for Oakland's community cats. Check out the campaign video below and get your calendar at bit.ly/hoodcats2018 🐈
