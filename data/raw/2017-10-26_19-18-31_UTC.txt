Now up for adoption: Didi! This little lady is a superstar. She's spent about 6 months healing from surgery and is now ready to find a loving family who understands the limitations of her mobility. We fall in love with Didi every time we see her and think her future adopters will feel the same way! Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about adopting 🐈
