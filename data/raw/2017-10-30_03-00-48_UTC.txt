We connected lots of families this weekend, including some of our Forgotten Kitten Project graduates. Six of our young tabbies went home in three pairs. We can't think of a better way to celebrate #NationalCatDay! If you're looking to adopt, email us at info@cattownoakland.org and we'll help you find your perfect match 🐈
