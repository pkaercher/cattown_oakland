We've had an incredible few weeks of adoptions at Cat Town! On top of the 6 tabby kittens who found homes this weekend, lots of other cats joined their families, including Penelope, whose foster parents made it official with an adoption! Interested in adding a feline companion to your home? Email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting 🐈
