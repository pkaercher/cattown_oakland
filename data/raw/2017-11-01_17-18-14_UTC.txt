Ferb (first photo) and Phinneas are in need of a foster ASAP. This pair is dealing with calici virus and need a cat-free space where they can get back to good health. Ideally, someone with cat experience and a home in close proximity to our vet in Rockridge would be the best fit. If you or someone you know can foster this pair, please reach out to us at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
