#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Nero and Cerotti (FKA Jeff and Akbar) were pretty under socialized when they were in the Cat Zone. But their adopters welcomed them home with open hearts and minds. With time and love the pair has been able to blossom. Be a hero to a cat in need! Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about adopting from Cat Town 🐈
