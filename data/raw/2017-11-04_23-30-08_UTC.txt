We are so excited for Toto, our first senior adoption to happen during Adopt-a-Senior-Pet month! Even more exciting, she's a #foster fail, AKA her foster mom just couldn't imagine parting ways. See all our current cats 7 and up at cattownoakland.org/senior-cats. Senior adoption fees just $20 all month long 🐈
