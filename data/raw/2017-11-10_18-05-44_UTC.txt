Photo from @catmanofwestoakland, who tagged along on a recent vet visit with newly fostered, Ferb (pictured) and Phineas. Thank you to all who helped us get this pair out of the shelter so they could start treatment for their calisi virus. And as always, thanks to Claremont Veterinary Hospital for helping these two, and all our Cat Town cats
