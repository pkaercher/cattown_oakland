Photo repost from our Volunteer Coordinator, Jay, who just saw Captain off to his new home! At 7-years-old, Captain is just at the start of his golden years, but we think being adopted during Adopt-a-Senior-Pet month is a real sign that he's on his way to happily ever after! See all our current seniors looking for homes at cattownoakland.org/senior-cats 🐈
