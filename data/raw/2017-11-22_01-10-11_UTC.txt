Raven, Fawn, and Tiger are 3 recent additions to our Forgotten Kitten Project. Each of them is at a different stage in their progress and our volunteers will be working closely with them to help build the confidence they need to be adopted. Stay tuned for future updates on these and other forgotten kittens in our weekly #KittenWire blog posts 🐈
