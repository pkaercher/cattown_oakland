We've helped more than 1700 cats in our 6+ years of rescue work, and thanks to you, those sick, senior, shy, stressed, and under socialized cats have found their homes. But tomorrow's vulnerable shelter cats are still depending on your support. Won't you build a future for Cat Town's cats? Donate today at bit.ly/cattowndonate 🐈
