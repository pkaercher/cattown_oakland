We are so in love with this portrait of foster cat, Marcella, just waiting to go home with her when she's adopted. Marcella is a sweet and spunky little cat who would do well with a feline friend, and might even enjoy the company of a dog. With a little extra attention to her health, Marcella is destined to live a full life! Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn about adopting 🐈
