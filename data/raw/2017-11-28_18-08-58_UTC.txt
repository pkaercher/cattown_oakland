This holiday season, you could buy a sweater destined to end up in the back of a closet, or you could give the gift of a second chance to vulnerable shelter cats in need. This Giving Tuesday your gift is TRIPLED--but only for the next 24 hours! We hope you'll consider supporting Cat Town and the work we're doing to change the face of rescue work in America.
