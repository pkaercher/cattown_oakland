Marcella is a sweet cat who loves to play and soak up pets. She also has a chronic eye condition, something that doesn’t slow her down, but was a barrier to her future adoption at the shelter. Cats like Marcella need a second chance. With your support, we can keep helping vulnerable shelter cats find loving homes. Donate today—your gift will be TRIPLED through midnight tonight 🐈
