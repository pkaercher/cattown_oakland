Cassie is one of our newest foster cats now up for adoption! She's sweet and playful, just give her a little time to warm up to her new home and she'll reveal her companionable nature. With FIV she should have an indoor only home, but it doesn't slow her down in any other way. Email info@cattownoakland.irg to talk about adopting 🐈
