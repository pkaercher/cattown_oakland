helping older shelter kittens is fulfilling, but resource heavy work. That's why we need your support to help kittens like Salem and Raine learn to trust humans before being adopted. Our Cat Care Coordinator Marie tells their story, up now at bit.ly/salemandraine, and you can support our work by donating via the link in our bio 🐈
