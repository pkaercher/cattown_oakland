Just a couple weeks ago, Buzz was known as the "Angry Tabby". But in his studio, he has room to jump and play and get lots of pets. He's still learning how to be around people, but soon he'll be up for adoption! A change of environment can mean a world of difference for a shelter cat in need. Thank you for helping us help cats like Buzz 🐈
