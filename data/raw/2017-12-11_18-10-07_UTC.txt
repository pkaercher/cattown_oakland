Are you an experienced cat person? Perhaps you could foster Topaz. Now that her kittens have grown up, she is ready to settle into a home of her own. Still being a bit under-socialized, we'd like to find her a foster who can help her develop confidence and trust with people. Email info@cattownoakland.org if you can foster 🐈
