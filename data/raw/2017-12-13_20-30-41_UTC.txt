Alvin, Ginger, Astaire, and Isadora, named for famous dancers, love to move their feet during play time! We're currently treating them for a skin mite, but we would happily show the process to any potential adopters, as well as provide medicine to complete the treatment. If you're ready to adopt a sweet and playful pair, email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more 🐈
