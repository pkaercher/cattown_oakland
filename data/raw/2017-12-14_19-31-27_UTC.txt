#tbt to our first meeting with Charlie at the shelter a few months back. We knew he was eager for human affection, but needed the comforts of home to truly be himself. Now we're happy to report that this sweet guy has been adopted! If you're looking to bring home a new best friend, email info@cattownoakland.org so we can help you find your match 🐈
