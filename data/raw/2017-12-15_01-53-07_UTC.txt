For cats like Buzz, arriving at the shelter is a scary and unpredictable experience. That's why we partner with Oakland Animal Services to give the cats least likely to be adopted a way home. With your donation, you'll help secure that second chance. Donate at bit.ly/cattowndonate today and your gift will be doubled 🐈
