When Bailey was recently adopted, we were reminded of how important it is we keep saving these vulnerable shelter cats. But we can't do it without your help. Donating to Cat Town means giving cats with severe medical needs, like Bailey, the second chance they need. Give before midnight tonight, and your gift will be TRIPLED to help Cat Town save more cats with medical needs. bit.ly/cattowndonate 🐈
