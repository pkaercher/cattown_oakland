What an incredible day for cat rescue! Because you believe in the Cat Town mission and donated so generously, we just secured a $30K grant #ThanksToMaddie. We can't wait to share the results of your generosity with you, so prepare to see each and every vulnerable shelter cat you helped us rescue right here. All we can say is thank you, thank you, thank you 🐈
