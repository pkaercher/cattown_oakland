Summer came to Cat Town as an untouchable kitten. While she's still building confidence, she's made great progress with the help of her foster mom, and continues to blossom every day. You can adopt Summer and help her come into her own. Read her bio at cattownoakland.org/summer and email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting 🐈
