As we get ready to ring in the new year, Cat Town has resolved to help more vulnerable cats find their way out of the shelter, in Oakland and beyond. You can help us succeed by donating *today*, because one of our supporters has pledged to TRIPLE your donations, up to $3,000 (but only until midnight!). bit.ly/cattowndonate 🐈
