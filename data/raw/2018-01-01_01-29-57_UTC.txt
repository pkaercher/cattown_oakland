At Cat Town, we know from experience that time can be the biggest factor in helping a shelter cat like Trevor, but time is a resource shelters don't usually have, and many rescues won't help a cat if they think it will take too long for them to be adopted. Won't you help shelter cats who need a bit more time by supporting our work? Donate tonight by midnight and your gift will be triple matched - bit.ly/cattowndonate 🐈
