Monk is just about the sweetest cat on the block. He's been spending time in our studios at Cat Town, getting to know our staff and volunteers, and melting every heart in the process. He's still on the hunt for a kind and gentle foster, so if you're ready and able, please email info@cattownoakland.org #SeniorCatSunday 🐈
