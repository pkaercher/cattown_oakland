Meg is waiting for the BART after a busy day of lounging. She’s part of our Forgotten Kitten Project, and is building confidence with the help of staff, volunteers, and visitors. We’re closed today and tomorrow, but hope you’ll come help socialize our cats when we re-open our door Wednesday morning at 10am 🐈
