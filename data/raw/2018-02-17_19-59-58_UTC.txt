Eloise (middle) has come a long way since her early days at Cat Town. Her foster brothers (Cat Town alum themselves) have helped her feel comfortable and her patient foster mom is helping her build confidence. Now all she needs is a loving adopter. Email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting 🐈
