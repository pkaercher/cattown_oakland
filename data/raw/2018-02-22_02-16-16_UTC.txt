FOSTER NEEDED: We're looking for a open-hearted guardian for senior pair, Chester and Daphne. After losing their human a few months back, we're hoping to get them into a calm space where they can feel like themselves again. If you or someone you know can foster, please reach out to us at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
