#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Phoenix (left) and Peanut arrived at Cat Town at different times with different needs and different personalities. But as fate would have it, they came to be buddies thanks to their fosters turned adopters. If you’re interested in fostering or adopting please email info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
