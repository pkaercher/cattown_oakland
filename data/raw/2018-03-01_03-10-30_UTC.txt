We’re getting ready for a big project in our studios at the end of March and hope to find homes for all our current residents before then. Nancy, one of our seniors, is looking for a cat-savvy foster or adopter who can help her with thyroid medicine and has a comfy lap to sit it. Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more 🐈
