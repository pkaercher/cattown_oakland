The animal rescue world is one largely built on the backs of women, and Cat Town is no exception. We are endlessly grateful to the many women whose love and determination improves the lives of vulnerable shelter cats — within our organization and all over the world. Thank you for your tireless dedication and happy International Women's Day 🐈
