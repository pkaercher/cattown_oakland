Do you want to make a BIG difference for cat rescue? Local artist Michelle Chan (AKA @ekke_art) is creating a beautiful legacy mural at Cat Town. This sketch of the mural is everything we'd hoped, capturing the cityscape of Oakland, the cats we save, and you — our community. If you'd like to be part of this work of art, make a qualifying donation today at cattownoakland.org/mural (link in bio) 🐈
