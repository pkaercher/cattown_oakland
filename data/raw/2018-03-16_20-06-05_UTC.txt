Early this morning Cat Town‚Äôs windows were broken. All of our staff are safe. We believe all of our cats are safe, but one is missing. We strongly suspect this cat is hiding on premises, but our staff are actively searching for him outside as well. We have years of experience finding lost cats, and are confident that we can find him. We are working on replacing our two broken windows, but our adoption center will remain closed until that can happen for the safety of our cats. The RAWR Coffee Bar (@eatlikealion) will remain open. If you would like to help with the repairs, we are hoping to fortify our adoption center to reduce the likelihood of our cats escaping should our windows ever be broken again. You can help with a donation today by visiting cattownoakland.org/donate (link in profile). Thank you for understanding as we sort this out üêà
