Yes, there are bad people in the world, but there are far more good people. Thank you to heroes like Daniel Johnstone of Johnstone Moyer, Inc, who found little Nadia trapped in the mud at his construction site and brought her back to us. Thank you to our community for opening your hearts and helping us recover. We are lucky to have lots of cat experience and are hopeful we'll find our missing cat soon, sharing updates with you every step of the way 🐈
