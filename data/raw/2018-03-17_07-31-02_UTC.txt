If your cat goes missing, keep looking! London, our missing cat, was safely inside our adoption center, and came out of hiding late at night. We are now showering him with affection. Nadia, who was found at the nearby construction site earlier today, is also doing well and getting all the love she deserves. THANK YOU to everyone who supported us during this trying time. We are so grateful for your kind wishes and generosity, and will be exploring all possibilities within our budget to improve the security of our adoption center windows. Thank you for helping us raise funds for these improvements üêà
