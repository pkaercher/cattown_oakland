#ThankstoMaddie we had cameras onsite recording yesterday's events, which helped us know exactly how to help our cats. We still can’t get over the outpouring of support we’ve seen in the last 24 hours and will be taking immediate steps to improve our security, all thanks to your generosity.

Now that the dust of yesterday’s break-in has settled, and all our cats are safe and sound, we can get back to our regularly scheduled programming—helping at-risk shelter cats find the loving homes they deserve 🐈
