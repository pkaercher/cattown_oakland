We are so thrilled to officially unveil @ekke_art’s newly finished mural at Cat Town. Thank you to everyone who made generous donations in support of our mission — the impact of your gift is going to help us save a lot of vulnerable shelter cats in the coming months! There are still a few spots left if you’d like to add your name to the wall. Visit cattownoakland.org/mural for more information 🐈
