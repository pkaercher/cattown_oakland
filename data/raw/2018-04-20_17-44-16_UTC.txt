Today we’re sending out a huge #VolunteerApreciationWeek thank you to all the members of our marketing and promotions teams. They’re the ones getting the word out about our cats—and our mission—through writing, photography (this photo in fact!), press, events, and everything in between! We are so grateful for your dedication 🐈
