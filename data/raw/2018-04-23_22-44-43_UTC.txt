Cat declawing can cause pain and behavioral issues for life. This year alone Cat Town has helped more than half a dozen declawed cats find homes after being surrendered at the shelter. Some of these cats had trouble walking after being declawed. Others, without claws for defense, were prone to bite when scared or stressed. The California Senate Committee on Public Safety will consider Senate Bill 1441, which would prohibit the cruel and inhumane practice of declawing across the state. They're asking for Californians to come share their opinions on the ban at a hearing Tuesday, April 24, at 8:30 am, in Sacramento.
