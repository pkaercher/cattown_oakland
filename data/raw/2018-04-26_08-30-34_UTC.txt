Today we're celebrating Maddie's 31st birthday! This beloved little dog inspired an animal welfare foundation, @maddiesfund, to honor her memory. Now, #ThanksToMaddie, Cat Town has been able to expand our Adoption Center, research how our work helps Forgotten Kittens, and show apprentices from all over the nation how they, too, can support vulnerable cats at their own city shelters. Cat Town owes a lot to this special dog!  #HappyBdayMaddie 🐈
