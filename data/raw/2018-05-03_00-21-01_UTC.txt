#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Earl (FKA Goji) and Boone (tabby) came to Cat Town separately in early 2016, but found home in the same adopters. Now they live a cozy life in San Francisco which we get to follow on their mom’s instagram (@jaimeborschuk.photo). Remember to tag #CatTownAlum in your updates so we can share with our cat community 🐈
