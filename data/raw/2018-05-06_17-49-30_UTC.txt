We need your help! Maisy is a total companion cat, but she’s still looking for her home. We know her person is out there, we just need them to know Maisy is out there. Tell your doctor, tell you letter carrier, tell your grocer—Maisy is ready to find her family! Read her bio at cattownoakland.org/Maisy, and email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting #SeniorCatSunday 🐈
