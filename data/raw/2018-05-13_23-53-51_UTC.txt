After a lengthy healing process from a tail injury, we knew Huey would need a hero adopter. Little did we know that hero was one of our own Cat Town volunteers! We sent Huey off to his foster, hoping he’d charm his way into a permanent home. Now, with approval from his foster sibling Clover (tuxedo), Huey has officially been adopted! To say we’re ecstatic would be an understatement 🐈
