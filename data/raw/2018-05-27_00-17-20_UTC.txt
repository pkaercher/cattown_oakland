Rashida was recently found stranded in a pit just a block away from Cat Town. Staff and volunteers rescued her, and she’s been recuperating for a few weeks, but she’s missing life outside. We’d love to find her a working cat placement, helping with pest control, or being an outdoor buddy to cat fans with allergies. She, and a buddy from the OAS Cats On Patrol program would love to join your space. Please email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more 🐈
