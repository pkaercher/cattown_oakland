One of the benefits of our studios is that cats getting over illness still get visitors. Volunteers and potential adopters alike loved spending time with sweet Juniper while she was on quarantine. She was so irresistible a fantastic couple fell in love and brought her home to finish her recovery! Congratulations on your adoption, Juniper! 🐈
