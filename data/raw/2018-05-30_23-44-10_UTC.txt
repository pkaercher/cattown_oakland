At Cat Town, senior cats with special needs like Sammy get dedicated time and attention from volunteers like Jennifer, who make it possible for our cats to find the loving homes they deserve. You too can help cats like Sammy by making a donation at bit.ly/cattownspc2018. And thanks to a pledge from the Cat Town Board, gifts up to $1000 will be matched dollar-for-dollar, but don’t delay—the challenge ends tomorrow at 9AM PST 🐈
