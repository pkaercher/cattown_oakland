We’re looking for a special adopter for house panther, Ford. This is one smart cat, and we believe he lived much of his previous life outdoors. That’s why we’d love to find him a home with safe indoor/outdoor access where he can split his time between cuddles and exploration. Be sure to email info@cattownoakland.org if Ford is the cat you’ve been looking for 🐈
