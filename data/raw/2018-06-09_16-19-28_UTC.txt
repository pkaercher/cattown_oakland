One of the ways we help our under-socialized cats get used to human interaction is by using back scratchers for pets before introducing hands. If you’re stopping by Cat Town today and you’d like to help some of our cats get used to pets and people, ask a volunteer for a back scratcher—it could make all the difference 🐈
