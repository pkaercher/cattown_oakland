ICYMI, we’re working with @oaklandanimalservices to foster a feral mom (Miso) and her two kittens (Lentil & Mushroom) in our studios. It can be hard to find foster homes for feral moms with kittens, leaving the little ones to grow up without exposure to humans. But in our adoption center studios, we can provide a safe space for Mama Miso while we socialize Lentil (pictured) and Mushroom. You can check out their progress on our live Maddie's Cam feed at bit.ly/cattownmaddiecam #ThanksToMaddie 🐈
