Becoming a foster is a big responsibility, but the reward is even greater. Giving a cat the chance to build trust, or just feel safe again, is a life-changing gift. Our fosters have helped us save hundreds of shelter cats in need and now you can too! Become a foster today by emailing info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
