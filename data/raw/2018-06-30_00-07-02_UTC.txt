Save the Date! This fall, we're hosting our Second Chance Soirée, an evening of food and music in support of Cat Town's efforts to give every shelter cat in need a second chance at finding a home. Mark your calendars for September 29th and be on the lookout for ticketing information in the next few weeks. We can't wait to celebrate with you 🐈
