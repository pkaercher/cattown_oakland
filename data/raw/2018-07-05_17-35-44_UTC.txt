We’re looking for big-hearted, generous people to foster cats like Chuck. Even if you only have a couple weeks to spare, fostering can make a world of difference. We’ll provide all supplies, support, and medical care needed. Learn more about Chuck and our other cats in need by visiting cattownoakland.org/cats-needing-foster (link in bio) 🐈
