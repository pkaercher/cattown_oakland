As part of our Forgotten Kitten Project, we work hard to help older shelter kittens socialize and find families. But just as helpful is intervention at an early age, keeping kittens from becoming “forgotten” in the first place. Check out this week’s Kitten Wire at bit.ly/kittenwirebeforeforgotten for details on how you can help shelter kittens in need, or email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more 🐈
