We introduced a few potential adopters to Maisy during her time in foster, but as a shy girl, she usually hid when meeting new people. But this past week, when we brought over her latest suitor, she hid for about 60 seconds before putting on the full show—head bonks, full body pets, belly rubs—Maisy knew this was her person! It may have been a lengthy journey full of ups and downs, but every second was worth it helping Maisy find her perfect match. Now we’re sending her home with full hearts and happy tears in our eyes. And big thanks to everyone who helped her along the way #SeniorCatSunday 🐈
