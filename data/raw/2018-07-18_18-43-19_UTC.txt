Folks, this one is truly urgent! Sixteen cats were brought to the shelter yesterday, leaving every cage at Oakland Animal Services full and putting our hard-to-place cats at risk.

Cat Town was founded on the belief that our community will step up to help animals in need, and time and time again that has proven to be true. If you live in or near Oakland and can foster a cat through us (or kittens through OAS), please reach out today! We will deliver the cat and provide all necessary supplies.

And if you aren’t able to foster we hope you’ll tell at least 3 friends how they can help. Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about fostering 🐈
