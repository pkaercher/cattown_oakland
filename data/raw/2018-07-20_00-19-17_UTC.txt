Anyone who’s met Marnie knows she’s a total sweetheart. But as a senior with medical issues, adoption can be a bit more challenging. That’s why she’s part of our ‘In It For Life’ program, providing life-long medical care to our senior cats so cost is never a barrier to adoption. Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more or to inquire about adopting Marnie 🐈
