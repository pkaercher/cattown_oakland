One part affectionate, one part independent, and one part adventurous makes Hope a well-rounded companion. We think her perfect adopter would be someone with some cat experience who has a large enough space for Hope to explore and play. Not able to adopt, but still want to help Hope find her family? Consider becoming her foster! Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more 🐈
