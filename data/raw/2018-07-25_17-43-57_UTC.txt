#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: it was fate when Kelli (the cat) met her adopter of the same name! Human Kelli recently wrote, “Our first week was a gradual warming up, as [Kelli] started out mostly in hiding...Now she acts like she owns the place, and she has me totally trained. Mealtime is a charming ordeal.  She comes out to the kitchen with me while I get her wet food, and then leads me back to my room...checking repeatedly to make sure I'm following.  When I set down her food, she actually waits for me to sit next to it and she comes for a few pets before she starts to eat.” Kelli + Kelli is a perfect match 🐈
