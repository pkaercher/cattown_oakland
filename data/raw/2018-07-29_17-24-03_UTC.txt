It looks like bonded buddies Patrick and Caleb have come down with a virus. We're hoping to get them into a foster home for monitoring over the next 6 weeks, preferably in close proximity to our vet on the Rockridge neighborhood. If you're able to help out, please email info@cattownoakland.org. We'll provide transport to and from the vet, plus all the supplies and additional support needed for their care 🐈
