We’ve been getting to know Mack over the past few months, and in that time we’ve learned that he’d probably be happiest living in a garden, barn, or warehouse space. As his guardian, you’ll provide food, water, shelter, and monitor his health. We’ll help set up his acclimation space where he’ll stay for 4 weeks before roaming free. If you’re looking for a pest control pal, or would like to adopt an outdoor cat who prefers to keep a respectful distance, this could be the perfect situation for both you and Mack!
