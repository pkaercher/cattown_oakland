Indiana, Virginia, Arizona, and Dakota have been living large in their foster home. But today and tomorrow they’ll be visiting our adoption center at 2869 Broadway, looking for homes of their own! We’ll be adopting these kittens in pairs so be sure to come meet them starting at noon if you’re looking to add two little lovebugs to your family 🐈
