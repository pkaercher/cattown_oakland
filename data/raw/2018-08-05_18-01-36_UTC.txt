Sundays with Earl? What could be better?! With a little life experience behind him, he’s learned that the secret to happiness is a balance of affectionate family time and independent relaxation. Earl will be right at home with a companion who has a little cat experience under their belt and knows that adopting a senior is a rewarding experience.
