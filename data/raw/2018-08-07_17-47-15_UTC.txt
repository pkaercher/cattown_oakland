Staff and volunteers have been working with Tiger and Fawn to build trust and confidence in our adoption center. Now we're looking to help them blossom in a foster home with dedicated interaction from a care-giver. If you have a spare room and are looking to make a big impact, please reach out to our staff at info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about fostering sweet Tiger and Fawn 🐈
