This week we’ll be a little light on Cat Zone cats while a few of our residents are being treated for a skin condition. As hard as we work to prevent it, sometimes something sneaks in! The good news is that we’ll have our mini-Cat Town space set up and full of kittens for you to meet! The even better news is that even while being treated our cats are still be available for adoption! Feel free to email info@cattownoakland.org with any questions about reservations or adopting 🐈
