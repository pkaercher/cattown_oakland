With the help of outgoing role model cats, Tiger and Fawn have built confidence, and through positive interactions with staff, volunteers, and guests, they're learning how to trust.

Check out the latest on their progress in this week's Kitten Wire at bit.ly/pairingshywithconfident and be sure to email info@cattownoakland.org to foster or adopt 🐈
