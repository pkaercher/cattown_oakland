You can tell by looking at her that 10-year-old Grand Dame Pickles is a no nonsense kind of gal! She enjoys pets and company as well as her independence and we’d love to find her a foster with some cat experience—someone who can appreciate her sassy spirit! Please email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about fostering the Grand Dame 🐈
