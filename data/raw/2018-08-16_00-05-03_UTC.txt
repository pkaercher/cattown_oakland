#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: at Cat Town, Atlas (FKA Simon) was a playful, confident cat who never let his weak legs get him down. These days he’s helping write dissertations and keeping a close eye on neighborhood birds while his adopters help him build up his strength —he is so loved! Follow his adventures at @cat.atlas 🐈
