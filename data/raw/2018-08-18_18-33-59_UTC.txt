As kitten season continues, our Forgotten Kitten Project comes in to focus. Older shelter kittens often grow up in cages with little to no human interaction. Historically these kittens have been thought to be past the window of socialization, but with a little time, a change of environment, and a supportive community, we’re proving it’s possible to help them find loving homes. Meet our adoptable forgotten kittens at cattownoakland.org/forgotten-kittens and stay tuned for more on the project as we head in to fall 🐈
