Lady is turning out to be quite the food critic! After decompressing a bit at the shelter, we're getting to see her personality more and more, including her passion for meal time conversation. We'd like to find a foster who can help Lady get back on her feet and fully blossom. If you've got some cat experience under your belt, a pet free home, and an interest in dinner time chit chat, email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more 🐈
