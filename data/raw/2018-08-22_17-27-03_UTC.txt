Today is National Take Your Cat to the Vet Day — and you can help Cat Town's cats get to the vet by supporting our Emergency Medical Fund! Last year a third of our cats needed veterinary care for things like injuries, infections, and viruses. We focus on helping cats with above-average medical needs because they're often the least likely to get support. You can help our sick and injured cats feel great — donate in support of our Emergency Medical Fund today! Visit cattownoakland.org/donate 🐈
