#TransformationTuesday: Lentil and Mushroom arrived at Cat Town a few months back with their semi-feral mom, Miso (who is currently being socializing in our studios). While the kitten pair was being cared for by mom, our staff and volunteers helped Lentil and Mushroom build confidence and trust. Now, after a short stay in foster, these two are back in our Adoption Center — and ready to find their family! Email info@cattownoakland.org to speak with our staff 🐈
