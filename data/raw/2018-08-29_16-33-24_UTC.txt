When people hear the word "ringworm" they don't exactly jump for joy. But it's something shelters and rescue groups across the country face every year. That's why we’re sharing what we've learned to help our cat community understand that ringworm isn't such a big deal after all. Get more info up on the blog at bit.ly/thetruthaboutringworm.And if you can help by adopting or fostering any of our cats being treated for ringworm, we'll happily provide supplies and support for care and completing their treatment 🐈
