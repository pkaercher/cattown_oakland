As the summer months press on, many kittens find themselves growing up in shelter cages. That's why Cat Town helps older shelter kittens learn to trust humans through our Forgotten Kitten Project! You can support this program by attending our Second Chance Soirée on  September 29th. Get your tickets at cattownoakland.org/second-chance-soiree 🐈
