SOS FOSTER NEEDED: You know we rarely use the word urgent, but this is serious. These kittens may have caught a contagious virus and need to go on a 2-4 week quarantine in a cat-free space ASAP. Please send any questions or foster inquiries to info@cattownoakland.org — we make fostering easy, and always cover all the costs. If you can't foster at this time, we hope you'll share with at least one friend 🐈
