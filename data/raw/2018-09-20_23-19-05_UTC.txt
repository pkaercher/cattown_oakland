We hate to do this so soon after our last ask, but we’re really in a pickle and urgently need a couple more fosters — Brooke and Mickey both need a cat-free space somewhere in Oakland or neighboring cities ASAP. Short term, 2-4 week availability is totally fine while we monitor their health. As always, we’ll provide all supplies and support needed during the foster process. Please email info@cattownoakland.org, or if you don’t have the space we hope you’ll tell a couple friends 🐈
