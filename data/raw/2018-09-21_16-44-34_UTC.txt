When Mae's at Cat Town, things get done! She takes on demanding roles like training other volunteers and turns around to put the same energy into helping us clean. That's why she's our September Volunteer of the Month! Learn more about Mae's love of cats and what brought her to Cat Town up now on the blog at bit.ly/votmmael 🐈
