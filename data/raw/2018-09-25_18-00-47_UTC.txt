Fostering a senior is a life-changing experience — for the cat and the human. We're currently looking for two foster placements for seniors Mini and Raleigh. Both cats need someone with a little cat experience, but will both reward their caregivers with love and adoration. Please email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about fostering. We provide all the supplies, support, and medical needed, you just provide the TLC 🐈
