He might be sporting a white bow-tie, but Ford is still a total house panther. This senior boy is full of adventure and curiosity. We’d love to find him a home where he can safely explore outdoors — a closed backyard or secluded garden would be perfect. And what better time to adopt Ford than #BlackCatAplreciationMonth?! Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn about adopting Ford 🐈
