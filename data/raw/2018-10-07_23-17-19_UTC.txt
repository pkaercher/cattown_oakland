What better way to celebrate #SeniorCatSunday than by becoming a foster for senior guy Raleigh? He’s a total sweetheart just looking for a comfy home and a guardian who can help care for his diabetes. We’ll happily provide education on how to help care for his illness. Please email info@cattownoakland.org to learn about fostering 🐈
