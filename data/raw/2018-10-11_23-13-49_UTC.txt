Our partners at @oaklandanimalservices have seen a recent influx of seniors, ages 12-15. The stress of a shelter stay can quickly impact the health of older cats, so we need your help to get them into loving homes ASAP.  If you’re interested in adopting a senior, you’ll have Cat Town’s full support and our “In It For Life” program means health care coverage for life. Please reach out to info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about adopting or sponsoring a senior cat today 🐈
