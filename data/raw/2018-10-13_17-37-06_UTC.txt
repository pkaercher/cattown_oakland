Peekaboo (left) and Miso have formed an adorable bond and are now looking for a garden placement together! The two, though independent, might enjoy some human company from time to time, but are mostly looking for a secure outdoor space where they can explore and relax. Adopting a garden cat is a great solution for a cat lover with allergies or someone looking for a mouser. Please email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about adopting Peekaboo and Miso üêà
