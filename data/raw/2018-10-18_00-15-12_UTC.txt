To quote a Cat Town staff member, “Sequoia is AMAZING!” We’re looking for a foster for this sweet, biscuit making lady. She’s dealing with some mouth troubles and we want to get her into a comfy space where we can monitor her health. Please email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about fostering Sequoia 🐈
