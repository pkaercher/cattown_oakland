Warning, this video may be too difficult for some, but if you are able to watch, you'll see why we've got to get Billy medical care now. Our partners at @oaklandanimalservices believe he was mauled by an animal. With their limited resources, they have done all they can to stabilize him. Billy must be in incredible pain, but as this video shows, remains sweet and affectionate. We want to give him some comfort while he heals, but don't yet know what his medical costs will be, so are trying to raise money to be ready for whatever he needs. If you can't donate, but have room in your home to foster, we think that will be best for his recovery. Please help ‚Äî cattownoakland.org/donate üêà
