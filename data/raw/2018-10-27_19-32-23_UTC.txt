Big thanks to our cat community — yesterday we asked for your help in getting Billy much needed medical care and you showed up in full force. We were able to get him to the vet where he had a full check-up and received surgery for his injuries. The vet thinks he has been living as a stray for a while, and may have been getting picked on by other cats. He’s now recovering comfortably with our staff while we look for a foster. Thank you again for your incredible support 🐈
