Despite facing chronic ear infections and a mouth full of infected teeth, Tony is a sweetheart through and through. As 10-years-old cat with FIV, we know he’d be much more comfortable in a foster home. If you can give Tony a comfy place to land while we tackle his health issues, please email our staff at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
