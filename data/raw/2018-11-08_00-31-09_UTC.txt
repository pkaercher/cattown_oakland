Happy #NationalAnimalShelterAppreciationWeek! Cat Town was founded specifically to help our city shelter's hard-working staff and volunteers reduce euthanasia for adoptable cats — and every day, we work to achieve that goal together. Whether they're identifying cats who are truly struggling or giving us time to find a foster for a cat in need, @oaklandanimalservices does all they can to save lives. Let's hear it for our amazing partners 🐈
