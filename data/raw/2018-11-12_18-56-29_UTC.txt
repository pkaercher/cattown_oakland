As wildfires rage in California and people are forced to evacuate, our hearts go out to families who may be losing everything. The future for many animal companions is uncertain, so if you live near one of the affected areas in Northern or Southern California, and want to help, we hope you'll consider fostering or adopting from a local animal rescue 🐈
