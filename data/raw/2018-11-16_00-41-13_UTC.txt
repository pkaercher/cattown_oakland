When we met Kitsy at the shelter last week, the first thing we noticed wasn't her blistered paw pads, or even her injured tail, but rather her glowing personality.. Despite having sustained some sort of trauma, she was nothing but sweet and we knew she just needed a chance to find her home. Fortunately, the shelter vet was able to medicate her paws, and we brought her to our Adoption Center Studios to recover in comfort, no matter how long she needed.

Kitsy immediately charmed everyone who met her, and after just 5 days at Cat Town, her adopter came along! She has plans to look after her injuries and shower her with love, exceeding our wildest dreams for sweet, lovable Kitsy. Thank you for making sure we can always help cats like her find wonderful homes üêà
