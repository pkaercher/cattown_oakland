Long-time fosters and adopters Cynthia and Kyle recently celebrated Eddie’s one-year adoptaversary with our community of volunteers. Because you helped make this story possible, we thought it only fitting to share it with you as well — bit.ly/cynthiakyleandeddie. We hope you and your families have much to be thankful for this holiday season 🐈
