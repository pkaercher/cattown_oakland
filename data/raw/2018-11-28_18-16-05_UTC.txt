Thank you so much for your generosity on #GivingTuesday — we are already putting your donations to work! At the shelter, 12-year old Pandora was angry, hissy, and covered in painful mats. Our friends at @oaklandanimalservices got her cleaned up, but didn't have a quiet place where she could feel safe. Last night, thanks to your donations, we got Pandora into one of our Adoption Center Studios so she can de-stress and get adopted. Thank you for helping us give her a second chance to find a home 🐈
