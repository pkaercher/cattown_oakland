Interested in becoming a foster? Beto and Bobby might be a good fit. Though on the shyer side to start, they both enjoy pets once they’re feeling comfortable. We’d love to get them into a calm, quiet foster home with a cat savvy guardian who can help them boost their confidence. Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more 🐈
