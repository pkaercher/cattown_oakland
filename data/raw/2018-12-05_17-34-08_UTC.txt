Help Cat Town secure this MEGA MATCH! For the next 48 hours, all donations, up to $5K, will be QUADRUPLED for a total of $20K to Cat Town!

These funds will help 10-year-old Tony, who despite a painful ear infection and a bad cold, never lost his affectionate nature. The Oakland shelter asked three different rescue organizations to help him, but they each turned him away, so we stepped in and got him settled into a foster home where he is now playing, exploring, and getting back to good health.
