Your donations help kittens like Monkey and his 3 siblings. These four cuddle monsters are all FeLV positive, and were struggling with parasites and severe colds at the shelter — especially sweet little Monkey. We just brought them to our Adoption Center Studios where they are being medicated and doted on by staff and volunteers. Soon, thanks to you, they’ll be ready to find their families. We’re halfway through our 48 hour mega match and hope you'll make a gift today to help even more sick cats and kittens get the care they deserve. All gifts will be quadrupled, up to $5,000, through tomorrow at 8AM — donate today at cattownoakland.org/donate 🐈
