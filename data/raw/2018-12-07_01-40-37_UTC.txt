FOSTER NEEDED! We just learned that senior Ace is likely dealing with liver disease and we’d like to get him into a comfy foster home ASAP. We’re not sure how much time he has left in his retirement, but we’d like to make these his very best days yet. Please email info@cattownoakland.org if you live in or near Oakland and can foster 🐈
