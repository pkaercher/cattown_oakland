When Brooke arrived at the shelter she was so stressed she was thought to be feral. But with a little time and patience she came out of her shell and revealed her sweet personality. Now we’re happy to report that she’s the latest member of the Cat Town #FosterFail club! Congrats to the whole family on making it official 🐈
