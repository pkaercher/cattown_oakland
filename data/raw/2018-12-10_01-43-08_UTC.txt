A little over a week ago we introduced Pandora, a stressed senior who arrived at the shelter covered in uncomfortable mats. We’re happy to report that she is now out, exploring her Adoption Center Studio, and making new friends. These are the cats you’re helping when you make a donation! All gifts up to $100K will be doubled #ThanksToMaddie through 12/31. Visit the link in our profile to help save more lives 🐈
