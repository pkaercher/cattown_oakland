Ace says, “Won’t you be my foster?” We’re hoping to get this sweet senior into a foster-hospice home where he can retire in comfort. We provide all the supplies, support, and care needed. Please email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more, or if you can’t foster we hope you’ll share with a couple friends 🐈
