We’re nearly halfway through the month and we’re about halfway to our $100,000 matching goal! When you support Cat Town before December 31st, your gift will be doubled #ThanksToMaddie, giving twice as many shelter cats their second chance. Visit cattownoakland.org/donate to make a contribution, and see our cats before and after coming to Cat Town at bit.ly/asecondchanceatcattown 🐈
