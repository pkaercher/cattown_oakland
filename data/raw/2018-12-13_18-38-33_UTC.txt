This is an all hands on deck call! Help us get Ford home for the holidays. This intelligent, adventurous house panther is looking for a foster or adopter who can offer him an otherwise pet-free home with safe indoor-outdoor access. His current foster space will no longer be available come December 19th, so we’d like to get him settled ASAP. Tell your friends, tell your co-workers, tell a stranger even, that Ford is looking for a home! Email info@cattownoakland.org to talk to our staff about fostering or adopting 🐈
