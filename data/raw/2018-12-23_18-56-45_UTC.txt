If you saw Ford you might think he’s just an average cat, but there is nothing average about him! Ford is one of the smartest cats we’ve ever met. He’s curious and adventurous, and after a day of exploring, he is just as happy spending an evening alongside his people. To keep his mind stimulated we’re looking to get Ford into a foster or permanent home with safe outdoor access. Please email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about bringing Ford home, or help us spread the word by telling 3 friends about the smartest mini panther in town 🐈
