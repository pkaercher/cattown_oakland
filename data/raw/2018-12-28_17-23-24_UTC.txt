Sequoia arrived at the shelter as a senior with kidney disease and a mouth full of bad teeth. Thanks to your donations, we were able to step in to get her immediate medical care and a great foster home. Just a week after receiving dental surgery this sweet old gal already has a playful spring in her step! Your donations make sure senior cats like Sequoia never have to spend the holidays in a shelter cage. Donate today and your gift will quadruple to help four times as many cats in need.
