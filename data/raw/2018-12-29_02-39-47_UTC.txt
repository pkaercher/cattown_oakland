Our $10K match ends tomorrow morning. Don't miss this opportunity to quadruple your impact for Oakland's vulnerable shelter cats like Abby. After growing up in the shelter, she recently moved into our Adoption Center where she’ll learn to play and build confidence with the help of our volunteers and guests. Visit cattownoakland.org/donate to make a life-changing gift today 🐈
