It's the last #SeniorCatSunday of 2018 so we wanted to share an extra special update on Billy! Earlier this year, Billy, an FIV-positive senior cat, arrived at the Oakland shelter with a severe puncture wound. With your support, we were able to get him much needed surgery and a loving foster home where he could recover in comfort. A few months later he's back to his normal loving self and fully healed, meaning this senior will soon be looking for his perfect match! Thank you for supporting our work and helping cats like Billy all year long üêà
