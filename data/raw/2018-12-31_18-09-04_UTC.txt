It’s the last day of our fundraiser with just hours left to double the impact of your gift up to our $100k matching amount. But what does it really mean to double your dollar? It means twice as many cats and kittens like Hammy with feline leukemia make it out of the shelter. It means twice as many seniors like Alice with Kidney disease get great care. It means stressed shelter cats like Daisy and Ivy can build confidence and find loving families. We hope you’ll help Oakland’s vulnerable cats by making a one-time or recurring gift today at cattownoakland.org/donate 🐈
