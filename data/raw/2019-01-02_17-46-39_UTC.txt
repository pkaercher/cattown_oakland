UPDATE: Thank you all for helping us get the word out about Ace. We’re happy to report he’ll be moving to a foster home tomorrow! We still have lots of other cats in urgent need of foster homes, so if you are able to help, please email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more.

FOSTER NEEDED: senior cat Ace is a total sweetheart despite dealing with liver disease. That’s why we’re working so hard to find him a loving foster-hospice home outside the shelter. Even if you can’t foster please tell a couple friends about Ace — together we can get him the comfortable retirement he deserves. Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about fostering 🐈
