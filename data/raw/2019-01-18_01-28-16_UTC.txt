We’re looking for a foster! Recently a good Samaritan found a badly injured Tammy and brought her to the shelter. They triaged her wounds, and thanks to your donations, Cat Town is making sure this incredibly sweet cat gets the surgery she so critically needs! Now we’re looking for a foster home where she can finish her recovery — and as always, we’ll cover all of her medical care and supplies. If you can foster gentle Tammy, please email info@cattownoakland.org. If you don’t have space, please tell a couple friends about this affectionate girl to help find her a foster as quickly as possible 🐈
