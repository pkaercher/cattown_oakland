As many of you know, it’s our mission to give vulnerable shelter cats their very best chance at finding a loving home. That’s why we’re on the lookout for a hero adopter who would be willing to help Sahara, India, and Geneva land on their feet. We’re still getting to know this shy, but sweet trio and would love to get them adopted together. Do you know a cat lover in the Bay Area with a big heart? Send them our way! We’d love to make the introductions 🐈
