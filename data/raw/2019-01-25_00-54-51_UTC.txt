Why is Suzy jumping for joy? Because she was just ADOPTED! That’s right, this former Forgotten Kitten found her home alongside alongside fellow Cat Town cat, Smallz! Their adopter has lots of experience with cats and plans to give them all the love and patience they need. We couldn’t be more thrilled 🐈
