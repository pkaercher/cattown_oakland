If you’ve been to Cat Town recently, you’ve probably spent time with Hammy, Monkey, Louie, and Maru, four playful loving kittens with feline leukemia virus (FeLV). What that means is they have compromised immune systems, but no less of a chance at a fulfilling life. They just need adopters who can keep an eye out for signs of illness and give them lots of love and playtime in the process — just like any kitten would want! Interested in learning more about FeLV or adopting one of these mini house panthers? Email info@cattownoakland.org to talk to our staff 🐈
