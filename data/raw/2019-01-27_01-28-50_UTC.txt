Rocket came to Cat Town last weekend after a stressful stay at the shelter. Now he’s decompressing in a private Adoption Center Studio as we get to know him better. We’d love to find him a patient, loving adopter ready to take a chance on this big tabby boy. Email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about adopting Rocket 🐈
