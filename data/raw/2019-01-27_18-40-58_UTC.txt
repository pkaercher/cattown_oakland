The sassy Pickles (Grand Dame Pickles to her friends) is looking for a foster. Someone with some cat experience would be a great fit for this senior. And even though she lives on her terms, those terms do include love and affection. Please email info@cattownoakland.org to talk about fostering #SeniorCatSunday 🐈
