Taking a chance on a cat like Lady is always a little scary, but so worth it every time. At the shelter she was so stressed she couldn’t be herself (swipe for before video). But look at her now, getting belly rubs in her foster home! If you’re interested in changing a life through fostering, or are interested in adopting Lady, email our staff at info@cattownoakland.org #TransformationTuesday 🐈
