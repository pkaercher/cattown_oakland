Ford loves a good nap, especially after he’s had a chance to get some fresh air and stretch his legs. That’s why we’re hoping to find him a foster or adopter with safe outdoor access. Looking for an intelligent, curious companion? Ford might just be your guy. Email our staff at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
