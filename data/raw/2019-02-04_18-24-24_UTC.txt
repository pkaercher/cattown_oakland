Ok cat community, we need your help finding Effie her perfect foster. We’re on the lookout for someone with cat experience who lives in or near Oakland and wouldn’t mind letting Effie occupy a little corner of their home. She just needs some time to herself to feel safe and stable again. Please email info@cattownoakland.org for more information on fostering. We provide all the supplies, support, and medical care needed to make the process easy 🐈
