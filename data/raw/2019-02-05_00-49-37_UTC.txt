Join us for a plant Q & A featuring one of @thesill‘s plant experts, Andrea Warren. She’ll answer all your questions about making your home a plant haven while keeping it safe for your cat. This event includes a pet-friendly plant to take home plus time with our adoptable cats. Space is limited so be sure to save your spot at cattownoakland.org/reservations. All proceeds benefit Cat Town's rescue work 🐈
