Who’s ready to make a life-changing difference? Sweet Katya is struggling to feel comfortable in a shelter cage, but we think she’ll blossom in a foster home. She just needs someone to take a chance on her. A pet free space would be a great fit. Email info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about fostering 🐈
