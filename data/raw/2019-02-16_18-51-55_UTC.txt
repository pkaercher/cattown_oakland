Grand Dame Pickles is independent yet sweet, and bursting with sass. And, we don’t mean to make her blush, but her luxuriously long whiskers are truly something you need to see in person to appreciate. We’d love to get miss Pickles into a foster home with no other animals. Please email info@cattownoakland.org to foster this beautiful old dame! 🐈
