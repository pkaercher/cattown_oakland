This #SeniorCatSunday you simply must meet Betty and Madeline! Betty loves to show off her tummy for belly rubs, and Madeline is a big fan of toys. This bonded pair is both mellow and gentle as can be. We’re open until 5pm, so be sure to tell these gals hello! Book your visit at www.cattownoakland.org/reservations. 🐈
