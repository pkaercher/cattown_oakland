Hey Oscar and Owen, it’s #TransformationTuesday and we are so proud of you both! When you first arrived at Cat Town you told everyone how scared you were with your fierce hisses. Now you’re rubbing against our legs and playing in the middle of the room! We know you’re not quite ready to go home, but we are beaming at your baby steps! (swipe for the before photo) 🐈
