Oakland Magazine has nominated our partners at RAWR Coffee Bar as Oakland’s Best Coffeeshop! We honestly don’t think any other coffee shop can hold a candle to RAWR. Do you agree? Give them your vote! And while you’re at it, you can vote for Cat Town in TWO categories: Best Animal Rescue and Best Nonprofit! www.oaklandmagazine.com/VoteOakland 🐈
