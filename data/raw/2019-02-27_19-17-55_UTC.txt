Monkey and Maru are such good sisters— they love to play and snuggle. Monkey purrs up a storm when you pick her up, and Maru loves to flop over for pets. Both girls have FeLV, meaning they have compromised immune systems, but neither kitten thinks that will limit the love they have to give. If you’re looking for a dynamic duo to brighten your days, come meet these two! 🐈
