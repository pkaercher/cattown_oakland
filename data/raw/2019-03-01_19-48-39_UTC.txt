After just three days at Cat Town, it was love at first sight for Juice and his new dad. We are thrilled that this spicy orange tabby has met his perfect match! Big thanks to our friends at @oaklandanimalservices for all their hard work with #OperationJuiceHome, and for taking such incredible care of every animal under their watch. 🐈
