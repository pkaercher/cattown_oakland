Looking for a cat who’s good with kids, loves naps, and will follow you around the house like a friendly shadow? A cat who thinks dress-up parties are... maybe the best? You have to meet Sparkles! As a declawed cat, Sparkles needs medication to help with the pain in her paws, but she makes it easy to administer. Anyone would be lucky to have this easy-going snuggler as part of the family — if that’s you, make an appointment to meet Sparkles by emailing info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
