Cat Town, OAS and FOAS are collaborating on an idea that’s got national attention: we hope to support at-risk pets *before* they ever get to the city shelter. Did we say pets, not cats? We did! If we win, this grant award would fund a 2-year pilot project to help keep at-risk animals (dogs included!) from ever needing to set foot in our over-crowded shelter. Help us keep pets in homes — vote before March 16! www.petcofoundation.org/showdown 🐈
