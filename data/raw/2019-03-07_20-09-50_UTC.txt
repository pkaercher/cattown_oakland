Part of our mission is to help sick cats get healthy so they can be adopted. Thanks to donations to Cat Town’s Emergency Medical Fund,  Jinx, Minu and Suri were able to recover from a nasty virus. They’re still contagious and will need to be on quarantine for a few more weeks before they’re ready to go home, but we don’t think they’ll have any trouble getting adopted, do you? 🐈
