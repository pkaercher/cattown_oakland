Only seven projects have made it to the national Wildcard category in the Innovation Showdown for a chance to win $450,000 — ours is one of them! Your vote can get Cat Town, @oaklandanimalservices, and FOAS into the finals. We’re in 3rd place, and this funding would help us support cats — and dogs — who are at risk of being surrendered. Link to vote in our stories! 🐈
