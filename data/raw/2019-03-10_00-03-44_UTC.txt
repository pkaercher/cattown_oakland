Bobbie is such a sweetheart, and happy as long as she can sense humans are near! While she does appreciate her alone time, Bobbie is a lap cat at heart and plays with the spirit of a kitten. We’d love to see her go to an attentive, nurturing, and patient home so that, even though she might have a little trouble seeing you, she never feels alone. Do you want to make friends with this gorgeous girl? Emails us at info@cattownoakland.org to make a playdate! 🐈
