Sweet Abby needs a friend! This youngster loves chin rubs, playtime, and other cats. Abby is part of our Forgotten Kitten Project, and still learning to be brave, so will need someone patient (and a cat friend) to help her continue her journey. Do you have a cat looking for a gentle buddy? Abby just might be for you. Meet her today at our Adoption Center! 🐈
