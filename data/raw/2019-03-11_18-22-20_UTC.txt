Who could say no to this face? Is Whisper asking to be brushed — her favorite thing in the world? Maybe she wants to chase a toy high and low? Or perhaps it’s time to do tricks like “sit”, “stay” and “back up”? Or… does she simply want to get adopted by someone who’s fluent in cat? If you have compassion and patience for an older cat, consider meeting Whisper! Just email info@cattownoakland.org to make an appointment 🐈
