Adopted! Monkey and Maru were part of a large group of kittens with feline leukemia at the shelter, and had nowhere else to turn for a chance at finding a home. These sisters charmed everyone they met, and recently went to a home where they’ll spend their days teaching their littlest human how wonderful it is to have a cat (or two) as a friend in life. Congrats to these sweet sisters! 🐈
