It’s #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday, and we’re following up on sweet Greybeard and shy Shadow. After being adopted a month ago, their adopter is thrilled to report they are both digging their new home: “Greybeard is the biggest snuggle bug around! He follows me around and jumps up wherever I’m sitting for more pets. Just yesterday Shadow started letting me pet him while giving him treats. He's still shy but jumps up on my bed with me all the time. They’re both settling in very well.” Thank you for supporting our work to keep bonded friends like these two together! 🐈
