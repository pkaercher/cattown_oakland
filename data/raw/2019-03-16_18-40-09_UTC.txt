Sherry’s fosters are moving, so she needs a new place to stay! Can you help her land on her feet? We’re hoping to find someone who can be patient in helping this little cat learn to make friends. Cat Town handles all of the cost, supplies, and transport. Please email info@cattownoaklnad.org to help Sherry! 🐈
