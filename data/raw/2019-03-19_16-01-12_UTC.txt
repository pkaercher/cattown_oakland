There‚Äôs more than one way to mark an anniversary. 
We could choose the official date Cat Town became recognized as a nonprofit, according to the IRS. Instead we choose today: the day when, eight years ago, Cat Town brought our first cat into a foster home. 
At the time no one knew what to expect ‚Äî because the common belief at the time was that nobody would want to adopt a cat who seemed so full of fear. But if you don‚Äôt take a cat out of their cage, you‚Äôll never know who they might be on the other side. Ann, our founder, believed that if she took the risk, others would join in to help. And because of people like you, she was right. 
Thank you for helping us save thousands of lives, and sustainably reducing the euthanasia rate for cats in Oakland to less than 10%. We are honored to be part of this community, and dedicate every day of work not only to the cats we help, but to the people who have joined us to make this work possible. üêà
