We opened early this morning to thank our monthly donors! Every month, their donations help us care for the shelter cats who need extra support â€” whether that means bringing a senior cat into foster care, making sure a sick kitten gets medicine, or getting a  stressed cat into a calm space where they can truly shine. Thank you to all of our monthly supporters!!
