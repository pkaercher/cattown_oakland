If you’re going to get sick, it helps to have a friend by your side. Ash and Li’l Panda are both under the weather, but keeping each other company while their antibiotics run their course. They’ve got their own private studio to keep our other cats from catching their germs. Thank you to everyone who helps us support these cats in sickness and in health!
