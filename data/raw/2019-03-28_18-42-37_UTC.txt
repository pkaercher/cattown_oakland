Pandora arrived at @oaklandanimalservices covered in painful, matted fur. They gave her a full-body shave, and Cat Town got this sweet senior into foster care where she could decompress. We are absolutely thrilled that sheâ€™s just been adopted, and wishing her many happy days of playtime, brushing, and snuggles in her new home. Happy trails, Pandora!
