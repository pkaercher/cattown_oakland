This foster cat is ready to get adopted! Quincy seems to have it all. He’s perfected the art of chirping at birds out the window. He’s mastered the art of rubbing against your legs, and the expert move of snuggling under the covers. He’s even a double threat: he knows how to rock solo cat life, or make best buddies with other cats! Send us an email today to meet 4-year-old Quincy at info@cattownoakland.org!
