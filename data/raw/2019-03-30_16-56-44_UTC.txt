Arlo and Lexi were feeling stressed in their shelter cages, so we got them into one of our studios. Now, their biggest concern is when they’ll be adopted! These two love to zoom and play, but don’t always want to be petted, so we think they’d be happiest in a home without small children. Come meet them today at Cat Town!
