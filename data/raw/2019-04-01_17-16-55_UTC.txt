This mother-daughter pair are peas in a pod. Little Clarissa loves to play and snuggle, but also appreciates having some personal space from time to time. Janet is still warming up to people — but her favorite thing in the world is playing with feather toys, glitter poms, and of course, with her daughter, Clarissa. Both ladies would love to meet you, so send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org to meet this duo! 🐈
