Adopted! Wyatt was in rough shape and needed his eye removed by the time he got to the city shelter. He came to Cat Town having never known what it means to have a family — until now. We are thrilled that he has found loving people to call his own, and can look forward to days full of purrs and biscuits! Thank you for helping cats like him find their second chance. 🐈
