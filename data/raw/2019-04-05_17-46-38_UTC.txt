This could be your view every morning. With Billy at your side, you’ll never have a shortage of late-night purr sessions, tummy rubs, or chin scratches. It’s no surprise that a cat as sweet as Billy has a shy side and makes himself scare when company comes calling, but if you don’t mind keeping this love bug all to yourself, let us know! You can make an appointment to meet him by emailing us at info@cattownoakland.org. 🐈
