The city shelter has recently seen more than its share of cats in need of extra care. We’ve helped many of their senior cats and sick cats in the past few weeks, and two more are now in need of support. Can you foster either Harlow or Percy? Harlow is incredibly stressed, and it’s affecting her health. Percy recently needed his leg amputated and needs a small, quiet space. If you can give either cat a place to recover, we know they would be grateful. Please email us at info@cattownoakland.org 🐈
