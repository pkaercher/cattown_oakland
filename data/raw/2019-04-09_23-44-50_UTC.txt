Remember Tyra? We got this sassy siamese out of the shelter for our Forgotten Kitten project and spent months teaching her to trust people. She's been in her new home for a little while, and her family just gave us this progress report: "She runs up and meows to me when I come home, she sits near me and gives me sweet blinky eyes, sleeps behind my knees at night. She and Sophie play all day and snuggle when they sleep." Thank you for supporting our work to help overlooked kittens get out of the shelter and into loving homes. 🐈
