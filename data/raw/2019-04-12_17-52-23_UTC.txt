Adopted! Arlo and Lexi came from a group of 16 cats surrendered all at once to the shelter. They were stressed in their shelter cages, surrounded by the sounds of barking dogs and so many other animals â€” but as soon as we got them out, they unclenched their muscles, and began to relax. We quickly discovered that Arlo is a lap cat through and through, sometimes not even waiting for you to finish sitting down before joining you. And Lexi? She loves to zoom around and play! We are delighted that this bonded pair went home together to a family who can give them lots of love, lots of play, and lots of room to zoom.
