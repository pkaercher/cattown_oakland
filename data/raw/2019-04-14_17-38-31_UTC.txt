Ellie and Eve are part of our Forgotten Kitten Project. Your support allows us to give them the time they need to learn to trust people. Ellie is a little more confident, but never forgets to check on her sister, who is getting braver every day. If you have a quiet home with no small kids, these girls just might be for you. Come meet them today at Cat Town!
