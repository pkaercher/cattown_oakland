Whisper is obviously gorgeous, but did you know she’s also a smarty cat? She loves to do tricks like “sit”, “stay”, “sit up”, and “back up”! Whisper loves to hang out and watch TV, adores being brushed, and as a senior cat, will have her medical expenses covered for life by Cat Town. If you’d like to meet this beauty, send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org.
