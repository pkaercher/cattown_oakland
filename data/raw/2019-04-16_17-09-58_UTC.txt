Adoption Story: Jillian had been waiting since January to be adopted. This sweet girl had been passed over at the shelter because she has feline leukemia, which means she canâ€™t live with FeLV-negative cats. Last week, we brought her to our adoption center, where she found her perfect match in less than an hour! Why? Because people like you help us break the stigma around conditions like FeLV, and show off cats like Jillian at their very best. Thank you to everyone who supports our work of rescuing hard-to-place cats find homes! (ðŸ“¸ @blangstedl)
