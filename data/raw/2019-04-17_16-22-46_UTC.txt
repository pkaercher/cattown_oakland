Why do we focus on helping the cats who struggle at the shelter? Because of messages like this that we get from adopters: “Cat Town, thank you for this opportunity. It really brightens my day to come home after a long day of class and work and to see my furry friend, YY. I enjoy studying at home with her by my side. She is so sweet.” Your support makes everything we do possible for senior cats like Yin Yang, little kittens learning how to trust, and every cat in between. Thank you for believing in our mission to help these overlooked cats find great homes!
