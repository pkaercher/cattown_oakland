If there would be an award for most laid back cat, Maggie would win. She's looking for a home where she can get showered with head scratches and snuggles, and she offers loud purrs in return. She's part of the shadow cat club, not because of her color, but because she likes to follow her people around. Maggie would be a great cat for any household and is ok as a solo cat or with a pal. If you think you might be Maggie's person, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
