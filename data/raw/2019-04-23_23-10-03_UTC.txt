The only thing better than snuggling up with a sweet, fluffy cat? Snuggling up with two cats! Belle and Brady are the perfect bonded pair and do everything together. As kittens, play time is a priority! A close second is lap time. New spaces and people can be a bit overwhelming at first, but once these beauties gain confidence they are a bundle of joy and curiosity. If youâ€™ve got some cat experience, a bit of patience, and a lot of love, this sibling duo would love to get to know you! Email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting.
