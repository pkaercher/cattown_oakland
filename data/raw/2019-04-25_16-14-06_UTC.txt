Ten-year-old Sequoia is one giant love bug! She’s known for giving hugs, kisses, and gazing adoringly into her foster mom’s eyes, even after taking her daily medication. Because she has some chronic medical needs, we would like to see her go home to an experienced pet owner with lots of loving patience to give. Sequoia is also in our “In It for Life” program, so we’ll cover her medical care for the rest of her days. To meet this affectionate girl, send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org!
