Percy is quickly recovering from the leg amputation he received at @oaklandanimalservices after being shot. He purred the entire way from the shelter to his new Cat Town foster home, where heâ€™s now enjoying cuddles and bird watching. We are so lucky to have a community like you helping every shelter cat who needs us. Thank you!
