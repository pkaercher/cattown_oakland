Today we are celebrating Maddie’s birthday! Feisty and beloved Maddie inspired a revolution, and her humans founded Maddie’s Fund in her honor. Cat Town has received an incredible amount of  support from @maddiesfund — we would not be able to do what we do without their support, and for that we are eternally grateful! #thankstomaddie we can help more cats, get them out of cages and into a safe environment - either a foster home or our adoption center. Happy birthday, Maddie!
