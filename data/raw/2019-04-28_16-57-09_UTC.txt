Bobbie is a Russian Blue that will melt into your warm lap, transforming into the sweetest cat once she's made a house her home. At 12 years old she might technically be considered a senior, but if you bring out her toys, she’ll come alive with the energy and high-spirits of a kitten! Bobbie has a vision impairment, which is why we'd like to see her go home to an attentive, nurturing and patient home. But as long as she can sense humans near her, she remains calm and content — she just has more fun if someone’s there to make sure she sees where her toys go sometimes!
