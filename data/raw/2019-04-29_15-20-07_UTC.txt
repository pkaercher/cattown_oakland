Are you looking for an easy feline companion? Five-year-old Cassidy just might be the cat for you! This playful tuxedo knows what she wants, and if she's not playing with her favorite toy, she will put her paw gently on your lap to remind you to keep giving her attention. It may take Cassidy some time to develop her confidence, but once she has gained it, she makes a perfect cat for any cat lover! Get in touch by email to meet Cassidy: info@cattownoakland.org.
