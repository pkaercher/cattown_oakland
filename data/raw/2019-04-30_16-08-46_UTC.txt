Cat Town Alum Asher was adopted last October, and we just got a heartwarming message from his adopter, letting us know that Asher settled in just fine! "I've been meaning to send an email and tell everyone at Cat Town how happy I am that I adopted Asher. He's such a GOOD CAT and we have become fast friends. He's been such a wonderful addition to my life... thank you so much for making it happen!" We're so glad this cutie found a loving home â€” thank you for making these success stories happen!
