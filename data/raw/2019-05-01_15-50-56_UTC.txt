Arlo and Lexi are adopted! They are in love with their new home, and it goes both ways. Their adopters say it best: "WE LOVE ARLO AND LEXI!!!!!" Both cats can be found lounging just about anywhere in the house, but Arlo especially loves cuddling and tummy rubs. We are so happy these two cats now have a loving home!
