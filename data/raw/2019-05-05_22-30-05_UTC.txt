We couldn't be happier to share that Bubba has found a home! This gentle cat ended up at @oaklandanimalservices after being abused by neighborhood kids. This made it challenging for Bubba to trust other humans â€” he came to us initially fearful and unsure about human interaction. With patience and dedication, our volunteers were able to regain his trust.  We are so glad that he has now been adopted into a loving home, and snuggles on the bed with his adopters at night. Thank you for helping us save cats like Bubba, who need a second chance at finding love!
