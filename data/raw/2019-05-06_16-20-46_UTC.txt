Lovable Katya lives for attention and affection, and returns the love twice over. Adopt her, and you will have a best friend from the moment you walk in the door to the second your head hits the pillow at night. Katya developed a nervous grooming habit in the shelter, but we know with time and a loving place to call her own, this sweetie pie will grow her beautiful fur back for good. If you're looking for a lap cat, email info@cattownakland.org to meet this precious four-year-old!
