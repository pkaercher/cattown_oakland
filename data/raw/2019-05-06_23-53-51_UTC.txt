Sweet senior Baji is out for a walk in the Cat Zone! In many ways, Baji is a Cat Town poster child: she needs fluids every day, several different medications and frequent feedings. She is well cared for by Cat Town staff in a loving environment, being given the chance to live out her days outside of a cage. Your contribution to Cat Town helps cats like Baji — we couldn’t do it without you!
