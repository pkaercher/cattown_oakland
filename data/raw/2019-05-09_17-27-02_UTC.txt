Are you looking for an independent, playful duo? Janet and Clarissa are a mother-daughter pair who have been patiently waiting for their forever home. Clarissa is the more confident of the two, and has adorable polydactyl paws to match her playful personality. Her mother Janet will trade slow blinks with you, but is still warming up to people and needs space to grow her trust and confidence. If you are interested in adopting this pair email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
