As a senior lady with lots of cat life experience, Emma knows what she likes: a warm spot of sunlight, affectionate company, and a good head scratch. She's a huge sweetheart once she settles in, who loves to be pet and doted on. Since Emma has asthma, she'll need daily medication, but her condition doesn't prevent her from giving extra cuddles, or enjoying time spent with other cat friends! If youâ€™d like to meet this sweet lady, email info@cattownoakland.org.
