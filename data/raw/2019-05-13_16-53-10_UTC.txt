Carmichael and Bowie Lane are a bonded pair that love three things: catnip, licking you when being pet, and most importantly â€” each other. They are looking for a home where they can cuddle on the couch together, and after nap time, play with their toys. If you're interested in adopting these two, email info@cattownoakland.org to set up a meeting!
