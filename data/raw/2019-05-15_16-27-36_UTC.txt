#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Meg and Chet were adopted a little over a year ago, and they are doing splendidly in their home! They came to Cat Town as part of our Forgotten Kitten Project. Today they are known as the power pair Princess Meg and Handsome Chet. They even have their own instagram! Follow them @meg.n.chet to never miss another photo update of these cuties.
