Mini is patiently waiting for her perfect human companion — can you adopt this quirky senior lady? Combine the independence of a senior cat with the companionable nature of a friendly young feline, and you’ll get Mini. She will greet you at the front door, and adores spending time on your lap. Mini needs a special diet and medication, but she is ready to find the right people to love forever, and will reward them with overnight cuddles. Mini has been featured in our art show located at Cat Town — the piece has been donated by the artist and her lucky adopter will take home the original work to commemorate the occasion! If you are interested in meeting Mini, email info@cattownoakland.org.
