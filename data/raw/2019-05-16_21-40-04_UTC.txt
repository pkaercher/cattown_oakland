Chelsea has found her forever home! She and her adopter instantly connected the moment they met. Chelsea is a sweet, striking Russian Blue-looking cat that trills and meows for head scratches and cheek rubs, purring happily when she's really in the mood for pets! According to her foster, the key to earning her trust is patience. We're so glad she has found a home that will give her just that!
