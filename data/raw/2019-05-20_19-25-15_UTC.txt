Jasper is looking for a foster home! This super cute guy has been at @oaklandanimalservices for 8 weeks. He is a little undersocialized and doesn't like to be held â€” but we're hoping to find him a cozy foster home as soon as possible, where he can build his confidence. If you can foster Jasper, email info@cattownoakland.org!
