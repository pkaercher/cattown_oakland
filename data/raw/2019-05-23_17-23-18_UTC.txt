Will you be my best friend for life? Magnolia is a sweet and friendly girl, who loves to just hang out and be your companion. She has a slight head tilt due to a previous ear polyp which has now been removed â€” but we think this makes her extra adorable! If you're interested in meeting this playful young cat, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
