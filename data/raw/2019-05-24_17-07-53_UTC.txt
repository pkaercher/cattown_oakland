It's #FosterFriday! Did you know that we have about 50 cats in foster care at any given time? These cats are in the homes of dedicated volunteers, waiting to be adopted or decompressing from their shelter stay. This is especially great for under socialized, shy or sensitive cats, who can wait in the comfort of a home rather than in a cage. We're so glad to an amazing group of fosters â€” we couldn't do this important work without them!
