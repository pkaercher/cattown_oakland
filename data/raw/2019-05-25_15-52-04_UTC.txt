We couldn't be happier to share that Tammy has been adopted! Tammy came to us after she got lost, fell asleep under the hood of a car, and was rushed to the shelter when the driver heard her crying out in pain. We put out an urgent call for fosters with medical experience, and Laura @bayareababycats responded immediately. Tammy had extensive injuries, but thanks to Laura's love and dedication, Tammy was on the journey of recovery.
.
As time passed and Tammy’s injuries healed, she became more playful and silly — tumbling in somersaults after her laser pointer, chirping at birds out the window, and head butting Laura with such force that it always felt like she was saying, “thank you.” And after three months in foster care, Tammy was just adopted by @jessica_panther!

We could not help cats like Tammy survive, thrive, and find loving homes without our community backing us. Thank you to everyone who has donated to Cat Town. You’re the reason Tammy is enjoying each moment with nothing but unbridled enthusiasm. You can read Tammy's full story on our blog: https://bit.ly/2VWCGJk
