Will you take me home? Truman is a sweet boy, looking to find his family. His hobbies are hunting, playing, and giving his human endless affection. Truman is on a special diet and takes a medication to manage his food sensitivities, so he needs an adopter who can keep him on a healthy path. In return, he promises to always greet you at the door, and curl up with you—or on you—on the couch. Truman is currently in a foster home, so if you're interested in meeting this social guy, email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
