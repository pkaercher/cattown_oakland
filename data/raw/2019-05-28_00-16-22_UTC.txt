Peekaboo! Monty is hoping you had a relaxing Memorial Day â€” he sure did! But heâ€™s already counting the hours, and looking forward to new visitors when the adoption center reopens Wednesday morning. To make your reservations in advance, go to our website (link in bio). Walk-ins are welcome, too!
