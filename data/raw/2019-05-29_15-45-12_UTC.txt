This #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday our spotlight falls on Cassiopeia, fka Yuki. After going to her new home, Cassiopeia started exploring her new backyard on a harness. Recently she decided she would like to explore the outdoors more, and she is doing really well! These words from her adopter say it all: "Thank you so much for pairing me with the love of my life." This was truly heartwarming to hear â€” we're so happy that Cassiopeia is living her best life!
