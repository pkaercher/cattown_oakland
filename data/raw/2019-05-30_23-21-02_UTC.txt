UPDATE: Fievel has found a foster home! Thank you so very much for spreading the word and helping us getting him out of a cage!! He is now recovering in the care of @lindsayrunsonplants 💕 🐈 FOSTER NEEDED! Fievel has a broken pelvis — therefore we would like to get him out of the shelter as soon as possible, so he can heal in the comfort of a calm home. If you can foster this sweet 10-month-old orange tabby, send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org.
