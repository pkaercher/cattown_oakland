In case you missed it, this month's Volunteer of the Month is Liz L.! She has worked with Cat Town since 2016, generously donating her time and expertise both as a photographer and case manager. We are so grateful for the incredible volunteer team that helps Cat Town â€” we couldn't save Oakland's cats without them! Thank you, Liz! Read her full interview on our blog: bit.ly/cattownlizl
