We know that losing a pet can be devastating and isolating. The strong bonds we make with our beloved furry friends exists in a realm beyond words. Acknowledging your grief can help with the process â€” so we invite you to join us for a Mindfulness Meditation for Loss of a Pet. The meditation practice will take place in the Cat Zone, allowing you to rest in being, and help your heart heal. Center yourself amidst a room full of cats to increase the healing power of this special event. To sign up, go to our website at: http://bit.ly/cattownreserve
