Did you know that we currently have 11 bonded pairs and 1 bonded trio in our care?  Adopting a bonded pair is the easiest way to adopt two cats, because they are already best friends â€” that means happier felines and all the more snuggles and playtime for their human! Due to the number of bonded pairs at Cat Town, we've agreed to let them take over our Instagram for the weekend. We hope you'll enjoy it!
