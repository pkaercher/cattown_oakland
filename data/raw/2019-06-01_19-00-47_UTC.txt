Have you been to the Quiet Zone? My brother Levi and I think it's just about the most comfortable place to sleep. We like to pile up here with other Forgotten Kittens and bonded pairs â€” it's very cozy. Oh, by the way, my name is Phoebe, and I'm 6-months old. I'm still a little shy around humans, but I learn so much from all the other cats! I hope to graduate soon, which means I will be confident enough to be adopted.
