Hi! We are Cashew and Acorn, and we're a bonded pair. Here's a photo of us when we first came to Cat Town back in November. We've come a long way since, and feel much more confident around humans than we did back then. We've been ready for adoption since March, and are hoping to find our forever home very soon. Come to the Cat Town Adoption Center in Oakland to meet us!
