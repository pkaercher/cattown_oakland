Remember Sparkles? Adopted just a couple months ago, she fell asleep in the arms of her adopter when they first met in Sparkles' foster home. She continued that nap once they got home, and slept on the bed with her forever family the very first night! From what we hear, this senior feline is not only photogenic but also quite laid back. She's just happy living in the moment and being with her human. Oh, and she's also a Warriors fan â€” Go Warriors!
