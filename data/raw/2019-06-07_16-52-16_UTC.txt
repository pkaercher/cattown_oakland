Are you looking to adopt an indoor/outdoor cat? Ford is looking for a home that has just that. He spent many of his formative years as an explorer, so he would thrive with some safe, outdoor access. If he's not outside, Ford loves spending his days in the company of humans, pets and treats, or gazing out the window. He is a confident, laid back senior who will settle into a new environment quite quickly. Interested in adopting this handsome gent? Email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
