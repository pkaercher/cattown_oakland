Bobbie has been patiently waiting to find her family. Is it with you? This Russian Blue is striking: her coat is beautiful, and her personality softens hearts. Bobbie has a vision impairment, but as long as she can sense humans near her to make sure she sees where her toys go sometimes, she remains content. When she's not playing, this gentle senior will melt into your lap. We're looking for an attentive, nurturing, and patient home for her that will make sure she never feels alone. Email us at info@cattownoakland.org if that's you!
