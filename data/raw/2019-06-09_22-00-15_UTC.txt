Dino is a fabulous cat, there's no other way to put it. He is confident, fun and affectionate, and loves being near his favorite humans. While he may be an older gentleman, he does not act his age â€” he is as playful and spry as ever. Dino is FIV-positive, but this shouldn't affect his lifestyle apart from having to stay indoors. As long as he can get a good view of the outdoors, and has toys to keep him entertained, he'll be happy as can be! If you're looking for an easy to please and adaptable cat, get in touch via email to meet cuddly Dino info@cattownoakland.org.
