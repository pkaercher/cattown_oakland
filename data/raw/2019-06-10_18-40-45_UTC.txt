Cat Town is one of several local nonprofits working to find homes and help Oakland cats — another such organization is Feral Change. They dedicate themselves to helping the Oakland community control and manage its feral and homeless cat population, by focusing on TNR (Trap Neuter Return) to spay and neuter free roaming and feral cats. Not only do they rescue injured members of the colony, they also work long hours, sometimes after the sun goes down or before it rises — rain or shine. So here's a shout out to this incredible organization, helping our community in the trenches! We commend and admire @feralchange‘s dedication, and are grateful for the hard and important work they do every single day.
