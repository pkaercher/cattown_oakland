Every month we recall recent adoptions, and how many cats have found loving homes — a process that always warms our hearts! In May, Caleb and Patrick found their family — this was an especially joyful adoption for us at Cat Town, as they had been with us over a year. And 16-year-old Lola, who stole many hearts during her time at Cat Town chatting with visitors all about her long life, also found her home! We feel fortunate to have been part of these cats’ journeys, and could not do this work without our wonderful volunteers, visitors, and adopters! Thank you for supporting us in all the ways that you do. See all of May's adoptions on our blog: http://bit.ly/cattownmay2019
