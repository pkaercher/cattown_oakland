The month of June is considered the height of kitten season, which is why we celebrate June as Adopt-A-Cat Month! Every summer, shelters fill up with thousands of kittens that are newly born and in need of a home. When cages are full, Oaklandâ€™s vulnerable cats are even more at risk of being overlooked. So if youâ€™re thinking about adopting a pet this summer, consider adopting from Cat Town to help a cat find a loving home. Come to our Adoption Center, or schedule to meet one of over 50 cats in foster care. For more info visit our website, or email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
