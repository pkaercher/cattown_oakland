Tiger and Fawn are a bonded pair looking for their family! These two are very attached to each other â€” whether it's wrestling, snuggling up tight, or grooming each other until they fall asleep, they'll do anything together. They are very curious about their surroundings: one of their favorite activities is observing the outdoors from the comfort of their cat tree. While Tiger and Fawn are shy around new humans, they are sweet as can be once they warm up to you. They have so much personality and just need some love to bring it out! If you're interested in adopting these two-year-old beauties, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
