My name is Whisper, and I will be taking over Cat Town’s Instagram for a day! That way I can tell you all about myself, while the Cat Town humans stare at their square boxes — they call it ’working’. I have been in foster care with Cat Town for a very long time. I don’t really know why I haven’t been adopted yet, but I am patiently waiting for my person to come visit and take me home. My favorite thing in the world is being brushed, and I love to head-butt, or lay on my foster’s lap while we watch TV. I’ve been told I have a very cute meow. I’ll be sharing more about myself throughout the day. Meow for now.
