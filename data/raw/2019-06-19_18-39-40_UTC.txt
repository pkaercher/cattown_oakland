#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Madeline found her person in April, and we've heard that she is adjusting nicely to her new home! Madeline was adopted into a whole family of pets â€” resident cat Oliver can't wait to be her new BFF, and Madeline is getting to know the dog as well. Her adopter says "She is very comfortable with me. She loves chasing after a mouse on a string. She's very chatty an demanding of pets." We were so happy to hear this wonderful update on Madeline, and look forward to hearing more about her once she's transitioned fully into the furry family!
