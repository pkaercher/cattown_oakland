When Buford first came to Cat Town, he had puncture wounds in his tail and rear, and the muscles in his hind legs were severely atrophied. We think he was attacked by another animal, but the underlying medical issue of his hind leg is still unclear. He is making progress, showing small signs of improvement every day. Even though we don't yet know where his story will go, thanks to a one-year grant from Maddie's Fund @maddiesfund, it is one step closer to a happy ending. We are so grateful for this support, #thankstomaddie!
