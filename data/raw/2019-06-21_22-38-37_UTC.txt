A few weeks ago we needed a foster home for Fievel and asked for your help â€” today we want to express our gratitude for helping us get him out of a cage! Thanks to all of you getting the word out, Fievel is now in a foster home, relaxing and healing from his broken pelvis. A special thank you to @lindsayrunsonplants for taking him in and giving him the space he needs to recover from his injury!
