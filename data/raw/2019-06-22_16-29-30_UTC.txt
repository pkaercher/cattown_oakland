How is it possible that adorable Celeste has not been adopted? She is a purr machine and professional cuddler, and has quite the variation of adorable sleep poses. Sheâ€™s a wonderfully affectionate cat who will actively seek attention, moving around and headbutting your hands until you pet her. If you think Celeste might be the cat for you, email info@cattownoakland.org to meet her. To see more of Celeste, follow her foster guardian @ohsweetkitty!
