Just look at those enchanting blue eyes! If youâ€™re looking for a feline companion to come home to, Misty could be your girl. She greets her foster parents at the door when they get home, and will follow them around the house, happily seeking their company. Misty even has a nightly routine at bedtime, following her foster guardians up to the bed where she kneads the blanket in contentment as she settles down for the night. Misty is shy around new people, but once she gets to know you, this girl is affectionate and playful. To meet Misty, email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
