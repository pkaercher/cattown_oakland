Effie is adopted! After having to say goodbye to her first family, then patiently waiting in a foster home, this love bug has now found her new family. Effie loves receiving pets, and we are delighted that she has a home that she can fill with purrs and biscuits, and be a snuggle buddy to her adopters! Congratulations, Effie, and a huge thank you to her adopters for giving her a loving family.
