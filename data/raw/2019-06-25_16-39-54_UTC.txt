Cat rescue isn’t always glorious — some days it involves carrying 4 pallets worth of litter down to the basement. But what is glorious, and does matter, is the support of our community, including companies such as World's Best Litter! They generously donated this huge supply of litter, showing us that they #giveacrap about the work that we do. Thank you @worldsbestcatlitter for your support! We could not do this lifesaving work without these kind of donations!
