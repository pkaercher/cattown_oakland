It's #TransformationTuesday — the perfect day to introduce you to Andromeda, a sweet cat who has undergone an enormous transformation since she's been at Cat Town. Andromeda was fearful and stressed in a cage, so we brought her to Cat Town to unwind from her stay at the shelter. For the first few weeks, Andromeda was rarely seen outside of her cozy cave bed. Even though she had lived with a family prior to being surrendered, she was mostly shut down and fearful at our Adoption Center. A couple weeks ago we spotted her outside of the comfort of her bed for the first time, walking through her space and observing visitors walking by. And last week, Andromeda had another breakthrough: we were able to pet her for the first time. She is still shy, but leans in for cheek rubs, seeking human attention. Felines like Andromeda are Cat Town's reason for being, and seeing this change happen is beautiful to witness — every single time.
