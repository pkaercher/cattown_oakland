Can you adopt Sally and Charlie? They are the perfect team! Goofy and energetic, these two are always eager to play. They equally love affection, and will stop at nothing to get head scratches and tummy rubs. Charlie is the shy one, needing a little more time to get comfortable in a new place. Sally on the other hand is quite brave and loves to scope out and explore. If you're interested in adopting Sally and Charlie, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
