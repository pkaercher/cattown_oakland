We're delighted to feature Cat Town foster Staci S. as Volunteer of the Month! While many know Cat Town for opening the nation’s first cat cafe, so much of our mission is still rooted in foster-based rescue. "It’s so rewarding to see that (emotional) shift as we give shelter cats a chance to show who they really are", says Staci. She also shared why she chose to volunteer with us, and more about the cats she’s been able to help: the formerly timid Toby, and her current foster cat, Katya.
