UPDATE: Found a foster! 
Bruno needs a foster home! He is a sweet and easy cat in need of some urgent medical treatment â€” so we want to get him out of the shelter as soon as possible. This 8-year-old boy is unneutered, but he will give you lots of loving gratitude if you can provide him with a small space in your home. We will deliver him and all of the supplies! If you can foster Bruno, email us at info@cattownoakland.org, or share this with a friend who may be able to help.
