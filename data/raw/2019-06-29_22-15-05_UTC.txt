We just received this beautiful drawing of our bonded trio Geneva, India and Sahara for our Cat Town Art Program, made for us by @scary4cat. To find homes that Oakland’s most vulnerable cats deserve, some of our cats need an extra special person. To highlight these felines, artists create and donate original works to go home with each hero adopter and their new companion. We are still looking for a home for these three charming girls to go to together — whoever can be that hero adopter will be receiving this one-of-a-kind piece of art! If you're interested in adopting Geneva, India and Sahara, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
