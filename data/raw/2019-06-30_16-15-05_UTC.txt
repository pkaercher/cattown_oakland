Katya couldn't be more ready to find her human! While in foster care, this sweet girl developed an over-grooming habit â€” at one point she had groomed the fur off of much of her body. We have finally figured out she was over-grooming because of an allergy, and now her fur is growing back beautifully! If you want to meet adorable love-bug Katya, email info@cattownoakland.org.
