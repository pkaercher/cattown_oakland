Want your own ray of sunshine in your home? Adopt Sunny! This 2-year-old girl loves playtime, and will flip, somersault, and strike strange poses that'll make you laugh. When she's not chasing her toys, she loves spending time with her people and cuddling on your lap. Sunny is very affectionate â€” she will follow you around the house and in the morning, she'll wait until you're ready to wake up before snuggling up next to you. If you're looking for an affectionate feline companion, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet Sunny.
