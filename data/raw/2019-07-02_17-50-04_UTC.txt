Today we’re sharing the story of Jules, who first came to Cat Town in the spring of last year. As a former stray from the streets of East Oakland, she found her cage at the city shelter frightening, and wouldn’t let anyone near her. Meanwhile, Sabine H. was considering adopting a cat, and a friend of hers recommended checking out Cat Town. Jules caught Sabine’s eye quickly. While Jules wouldn’t allow anyone to touch her, Sabine was still encouraged. “There was always a look in her eye that said there was hope.” In September 2018, Jules went home with Sabine and her three kids. For the first several months in her new home, Jules hid under a bed 24/7. Sabine worked closely with Jules’ case manager at Cat Town through weeks of painstaking efforts to help earn her trust. Sabine and her kids showered Jules with her favorite treats and petted their other cat, Lulubelle, in front of Jules to show her that she was in a safe place. One of Sabine’s children would regularly read books aloud to Jules.

For a long time, progress was so slow it was hard to even see anything happening, but bit by bit Jules blossomed. “The day she first let me touch her was a moment of such pure delight it brought tears to my eyes,” shares Sabine. “Despite all her fear, some part of her just melted into my hand, and she hasn’t looked back since.” Sabine continues to be amazed at Jules’ transformation. “To see a cat who was so profoundly afraid of humans and yet who so clearly longed for affection and companionship overcome her fears has been rewarding beyond measure,” she says. “Jules came into the life of our family at a time when things were challenging, and just by being herself and letting us care for her, Jules gave me and my three boys a huge gift.” Read the full story on our blog: /bit.ly/alumjules
