Snow is an affectionate senior in need of a foster home! This social feline was surrendered to @oaklandanimalservices by her guardian, and we are hoping to get her into a foster home as soon as possible. Snow is deaf, and therefore very vocal â€” but she loves pets and human companionship. Email us at info@cattownoakland.org if you can foster Snow! If you can't foster, but know someone who might be able to, please help us spread the word. Thank you!
