Happy Independence Day! Cat Town is closed today, but we hope you and your pets have a safe holiday. Remember: while fireworks can be fun for humans, the noise is often terrifying for our furry friends. More pets go missing on July 4th than any other day of the year. Please keep your pets indoors, and make sure their microchip information is current!
