We hope you had a wonderful 4th of July — if you’re looking for fun activities to do the rest of the holiday weekend, come visit our Adoption Center in Oakland. Bring a friend, grab a coffee at RAWR Coffee Bar @eatlikealion and visit our Cat Zone cats. They’re waiting for your visit! Cat Town is open until 7pm today.
