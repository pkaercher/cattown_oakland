Can you foster Griffin? This playful guy is looking for a space with plenty of room to chase toys and show off his mighty hunter skills. As a former outdoor cat, Griffin would enjoy some safe outdoor access during the day, but as long as there are plenty of windows to look out of, he will be happy as can be! If you can foster Griffin, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
