Guinevere is a 4-year-old orange tabby who has undergone a lovely transformation in our care. Hesitant at first, she has now blossomed into an attention-seeking and loving cat who loves exploring. One of her cutest quirks is her chirping! All it takes to get Guinevere purring is speaking softly to her â€” she follows up with biscuits and slow blinking as she settles deeper into a state of zen. If you're thinking about expanding your feline family, this friendly girl might be the cat for you! To meet Guinevere, email info@cattownoakland.org.
