Poppy's photo takes the cake for #tongueouttuesday and #TransformationTuesday! This girl has come a long way â€” she first came to Cat Town with an injured tail, hiding from people, and hissed when anyone approached. These days she eats breakfast out in the open, and she's even started to accept pets. We're so proud of Poppy! Thank you for making this work possible and believing in cats like her â€” she never would have had a chance to show us who she really is without the support from all of you!
