Fievel, Pepe and Polo are all looking for a foster home! Can you help? Pepe and Polo are a bonded pair currently still at the shelter, and ginger boy Fievel is healing from a broken pelvis in a foster home, but is looking for a new place to stay. All they need is a small space in a home, and some care and attention for a foster guardian. The rest will be taken care of by Cat Town â€” we provide the supplies, and even bring the cat to you! If you can foster, or have any questions about fostering, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
