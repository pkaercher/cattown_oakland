Juneau found his family! This handsome boy helped our Forgotten Kittens to be more confident by showing them that it is safe and rewarding to interact with humans. After teaching the kittens in the Cat Zone, he has now been adopted. Thank you for supporting Cat Town, and helping us give even the most vulnerable cats a chance to find loving homes!
