Tyrion loves laps, snuggles and being held. He wants nothing more than being near you! If that sounds like your kind of cat, you’re in luck — this snuggle buddy is looking for his forever home. He needs an adopter who will keep him on a prescription diet to manage his mild kidney condition, but his gentle presence and need for cuddles make him easy to love. To meet Tyrion, email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
