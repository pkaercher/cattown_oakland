Hugs and kisses anyone? Sequoia is an affectionate girl, who will lovingly gaze in your eyes as you hold her. Not only does she love human attention, she also enjoys the company of other felines. As an older cat, Sequoia requires some routine medical care, but she makes herself easy to care for and rewards you with snuggles. If you're interested in meeting Sequoia or want to know more about her, email info@cattownoakland.org!
