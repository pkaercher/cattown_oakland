While we don’t usually know when an emergency or disaster will strike, preparing ahead of time can make sudden and unexpected situations less stressful — for ourselves and our pets. Whether you need to take a brief absence from home, or temporarily evacuate in the event of an disaster, taking steps right now can help ensure your cat’s safety. We’ve outlined 3 simple precautions to make sure you and your pet are prepared for anything.

KNOW WHERE TO GO
Have a plan for where your pets will stay should you find yourself in an emergency or disaster situation. It’s also a good idea to have a plan in place in case you aren’t home when an emergency arises.

STAY INFORMED
Research to see if your county has an emergency alert system for residents, and make sure you’re registered to receive them. Nixle.com is a great resource where you can sign up to receive alerts, and  you should also consider joining online communities to stay connected, such as @nextdoor.

HAVE YOUR SUPPLIES READY
Depending on the situation, you may need to leave your residence quickly, so you will want to prepare as much as possible ahead of time. If you have more than one cat, each should have their own carrier. Make sure you can easily access copies of your pet’s medical records and your pet’s microchip information. You should have an emergency kit ready to go as well. While many pet supply companies sell pre-made pet emergency kits, one specifically tailored for your pet is best.

While preparing to care for your pet, make sure you’re also ready to take care of yourself. You’ll be the one looking after your furry friend, after all!
