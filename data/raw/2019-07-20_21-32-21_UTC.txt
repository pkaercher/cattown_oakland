The Oakland shelter is completely full, so it is truly urgent to get some cats out by tomorrow, July 21st. If you can foster Baxter, Bee Bee, Spike or other lovely cats like them, please email info@cattownoakland.org ASAP. We'll deliver the cats and provide all the necessary supplies! Because of our limited capacity, we are looking for foster homes in Oakland, Emeryville, Berkeley or Alameda. Many thanks for anything you can do to help, or share with a friend!
