Cassidy is dreaming of her forever home. Is it with you? At 5 years old, she knows what she wants, and more than anything that's your attention! She wants to be near you, and will even go so far as to put her paw gently on your lap to remind you to keep giving her that attention. It may take some time for this affection to develop, but once it does, Cassidy will love playing and snuggling and all those good things. If you're interested in adopting Cassidy, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
