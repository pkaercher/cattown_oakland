Adorable Clarissa has a very special trait: she's polydactyl! That means she has more toes than most cats, and always looks like she is wearing mittens. Clarissa is still getting used to people, but she enjoys morning and evening snuggles, and has a fun personality to match!  If we had you at polydactyl, email info@cattownoakland.org to meet this young girl.
