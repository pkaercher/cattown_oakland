Bonita is a sweetheart of a cat who lives for morning and evening cuddles with her human. She will even come crawl into your lap when you call her! Bonita would be happiest as an only pet, but sheâ€™ll make up for the absence of other felines with adorable squeaky meows. If you want Bonita in your life, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet her!
