New York has just become the first state to ban declawing of cats! This effort was lead by @pawproject, a nonprofit that educates the public about why declawing is inhumane. Scratching is an instinct for cats â€” something they are born to do, just like meowing and purring. It is cruel to deny cats the ability to act on one of their most basic behaviors. Cats who have been declawed experience many negative side effects, including aggression and depression. That's why this bill is an incredible achievement! Congratulations to The Paw Project on accomplishing this important step! In addition to helping pass this bill, their nonprofit promotes animal welfare through the abolition of the practice of declaw surgery nationwide, and rehabilitate cats that have been declawed!
