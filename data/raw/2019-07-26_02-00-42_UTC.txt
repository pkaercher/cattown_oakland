Lilu still needs a foster! This gentle lap cat was stressed at the shelter, so we quickly brought her to our Studios. However, she's used to living in a home, and in these instances, nothing beats the comfort of a caring foster to truly help a cat feel at ease. If you have a little space for a super sweet cat, please email us at info@cattownoakland.org to help.
