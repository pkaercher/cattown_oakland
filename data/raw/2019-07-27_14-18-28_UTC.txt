Like peanut butter and jelly, Leila and Addie go great together. Looking for someone to keep you company, who'll chirp to let you know there's a bird out your window? A sensitive girl who'll assess the situation before letting you know the living room is safe? That's where observant Addie shines. Want an outgoing cuddle buddy who'll greet you at the door and investigate the most interesting places in your home? You need Leila in your life. These sisters complement one another perfectly, and are waiting for an adopter who will appreciate their distinct personalities. To meet this dynamic duo, send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org.
