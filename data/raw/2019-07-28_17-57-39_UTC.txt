After a total transformation, Katya is adopted! This gorgeous cat came to Cat Town with lots of missing fur. We diagnosed her allergies and made some simple changes to her daily routine, and now: no more itchy skin, no more over-grooming. We're so happy that she's feeling better â€” just in time to go home with her new human, one of our very own volunteers! Thank you to everyone who supports our Emergency Medical Fund, so we can help cats like Katya land on their feet. You make adoptions like hers possible!
