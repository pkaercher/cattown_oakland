Marni is on the lookout for her best friend for life! This young cat is beautiful both on the inside and outside â€” she will happily carry on meowing conversations with whoever wants to talk, and melt into a puddle of fur with a warm lap. Marni has tested positive for FIV, but she is full of life and personality, and her care only requires that she stays indoors. If you're looking to add a cat to your life who will happily welcome new friends and adores attention, reach out to us at info@cattownoakland.org!
