We asked you to help us find a foster for Lilu, but you outdid us â€” Lilu is adopted! Of the 9 cats we pulled from @oaklandanimalservices last weekend, Dinah, Nia, Baxter, and Lilu are already adopted. And that's because of you! You care about Oakland's most vulnerable cats. You help us spread the word when we need you. You come to Cat Town and fall in love. You decide to adopt a cat in need of a home. Cat Town can only be succesful with the community that stands behind it. Thank you!
