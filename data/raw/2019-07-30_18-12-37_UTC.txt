Do you want a shining star in your life? One that comes with a limitless desire to be petted? If the answer is yes, then you must meet Stella. This smart girl has extremely soft Russian Blue fur, and she's also polydactyl, which makes her extra cute. Stella has very limited vision, which can make her nervous in new situations â€” but with a little bit of patience, you can watch her thrive once she's memorized the layout of her home. If you're interested in adopting loving Stella, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
