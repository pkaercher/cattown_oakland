Biscuit is adopted! She found her family with our very own staff member Marie-Luise, and her resident cat Theo. As a Forgotten Kitten, Biscuit needed to go home with a confident cat — and in just a few short weeks she has learned a great deal from Theo, namely what time of day is best for cuddles. After a slow introduction the two cats have become fast friends, and were recently spotted grooming each other for the first time. Congratulations to Biscuit on finding a home and two best friends — @marieluiseklotz and #theotheoaklandrescuecat!
