#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Dominic was adopted back in June, and we recently heard that he is doing really well in his new home. He was given the new name Shadow, and his adopter says "It didn‚Äôt take him very long to adjust. He loves to explore, he's very affectionate and enjoys talking!" We're so happy for Shadow and his human! üêà
