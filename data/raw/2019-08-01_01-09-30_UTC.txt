Mondays and Tuesdays are always hard, because Cat Town is closed â€” but don't despair! It's Wednesday, which means we'll be open for the rest of the week. So if you want a kitten crawling on your shoulders or just hang out in the Cat Zone, come by for cats and coffee! When planning on a weekend visit, make sure to reserve your spot online: bit.ly/cattownreserve
