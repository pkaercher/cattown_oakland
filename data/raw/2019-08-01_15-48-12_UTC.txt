Ticket sales for our Second Chance Soirée start now! Join Cat Town to celebrate our biggest event of the year on Saturday, October 5th. The evening will be filled with delicious drinks, a carefully selected menu of food, music, and more — all in the ambience of Oakland's gorgeous @preservationpark. The best part? Ticket sales will support Cat Town's work to give every shelter cat in need a second chance at finding a home!
