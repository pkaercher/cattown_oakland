Today marks the 200th day at Cat Town for our bonded trio: Geneva, Sahara and India! Why have they been with us for so long? These three beauties were surrendered at @oaklandanimalservices after spending their whole lives together, and have been waiting patiently for someone who wants to adopt them all, so they can stay together.
.
So we're announcing a bold goal: to get these girls adopted by the end of summer, Monday, September 23. Will you take on this challenge with us? Tell 3 friends about our bonded trio, and let us know #challengeaccepted to show you're excited to help us get these girls adopted! Thank you for supporting our work to give these sisters the best gift possible â€” being adopted as a family.
