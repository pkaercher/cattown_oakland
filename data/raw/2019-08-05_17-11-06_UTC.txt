It starts with just a whisper in your heart, but with time it will get louder — what gets louder, you ask? The gentle voice in your heart telling you Whisper is the cat for you. Despite her 10 years of age, Whisper loves to play just like a kitten. When she's not playing, she'll rubs against you with a tiny meow, asking you to brush her fur. She will even follow your commands to “sit," “stay," and “back up!” If you're ready to hand your heart over to a sweet, independent cat, email us at info@cattownoakland.org for an appointment to fall in love with Whisper!
