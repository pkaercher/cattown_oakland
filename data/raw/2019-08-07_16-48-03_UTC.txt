Cat Town is launching its first ever T-shirt design contest! Do you want to help Oakland’s most vulnerable cats while getting your art seen? Submit your design by August 25. The T-shirt with the winning design will debut at Second Chance Soirée on October 5th! The winner will receive 2 tickets to the Soirée, T-shirts with the winning design, 10 passes to Cat Town and an article profiling the artist on Cat Town’s blog. Stay tuned, because we'll be sharing the finalists —and the winning design will be chosen by public vote! Learn more at bit.ly/cattownshirt
