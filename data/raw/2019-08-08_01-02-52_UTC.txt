Watson, an outgoing Maine Coon, and his inquisitive gray-and-white sidekick Cricket, are a bonded duo working on their next discovery: their future home. While they love sitting in boxes, having that place to call home and their very own human would be a dream come true! Watson, with his soft, luxurious coat, has a loud, deep, soothing purr, and loves being the center of attention. As for Cricket, he lives for play time, and is happy to select a new toy to test each evening. “He is a communicative fellow, and often strings together meows in a chain that sounds like sentences,” his foster parents says. If you want to meet these two adorable cats, just send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org!
