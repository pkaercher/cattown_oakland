As you may know, Cat Town partners with @oaklandanimalservices to identify the cats in most need: those who are struggling with life in a cage, who need extra medical care, or require a little more patience to help them find their confidence. While we are currently at capacity with over 60 cats in foster homes, we've also seen a number of adoptions this last week â€” so we're getting ready to place more cats in foster homes. If you have a quiet space in your home and time to give to under socialized kittens, a shy, sensitive or older cat, or a cat with special needs, you might be a great foster parent for a Cat Town cat. Email us at info@cattownoakland.org if you're interested in becoming a foster!
