Griffin is living his best life â€” the only thing that would make it even better? Finding his forever home. He has a lot of energy for his age, and loves to chase and pounce on his toys. Therefore Griffin would love to find a home with a safe daytime outdoor space! Email us at info@cattownoakland.org if you think Griffin might be your cat. He'll be happy to meet up for some playtime to see if you're his human buddy!
