Happy #caturday! Time to round up those July adoptions! It's been a month of special adoptions for Cat Town. During kitten season when the Oakland shelter is at full capacity, we try to empty as many cages as we can. We pulled a number of litters, and saw 7 kittens go home directly from Cat Town â€” Lars and Linda were among those lucky kittens to find a loving home. Check out the full adoption roundup on our blog: bit.ly/cattownjuly2019
