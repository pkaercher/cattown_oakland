Tiger and Fawn are on the hunt for their family â€” is it with you? They live for treats and playtime, and cuddling up together somewhere cozy. This bonded pair is shy around new humans, but with patience and care they'll warm up to a long-term guardian. If you're interested in meeting this sweet duo, send us an email a info@cattownoakland.org.
