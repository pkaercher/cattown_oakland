Want to spend a fun evening in the Cat Zone? Join us for Cat Man Bingo! We'll have cool prizes, cool cat people, and best of all, we'll be playing BINGO with a bunch of adoptable cats. The evening will be hosted by @catmanofwestoakland Adam Myatt. All supplies will be provided at this fundraiser for Cat Town. Mark your calendar for August 28 and and secure your spot now! bit.ly/cattownreserve
