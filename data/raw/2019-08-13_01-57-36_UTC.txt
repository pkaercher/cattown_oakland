Remember Truman? He's adopted! When Truman first came to Cat Town he was not in good shape â€” he had severe skin issues, and had been left at the shelter's night drop. Thanks to your donations to our Emergency Medical Fund, this sweet boy is completely recovered, and we're happy to report that he found his person! Here he is posing proudly with his adopter. It takes a village to do the work that we do. We are grateful for the close partnership with @oaklandanimalservices, his caring foster, adopters who choose to adopt from Cat Town, and every contribution we get from you, big or small. Thank you!
