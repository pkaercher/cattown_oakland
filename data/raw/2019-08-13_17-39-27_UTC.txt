When it comes to the amount of affection Sequoia has to give, this sweet girl is just like her namesake: one GIANT love bug! Sheâ€™s also patient like the gentle giants of the forest: she's been waiting for months to find her person. She enjoys being in her foster home, but she's ready to find that forever home she's been dreaming of. To meet Sequoia, just send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org â€” she might just steal your heart.
