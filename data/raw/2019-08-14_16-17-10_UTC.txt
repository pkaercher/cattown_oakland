#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Rivers and Kimbra were adopted from Cat Town over two years ago, and to this day, their former foster guardian still receives updates from their adopters! Recently they shared that "the most exciting thing to report is how good they've been about accepting homeless kitties into their home" Earlier this year their neighbor found an injured kitten: "We took him in, named him Sâ€™more, and the girls have welcomed him with open pawsI"
.
When Kimbra first came to Cat Town, it took months in foster before she allowed anyone to touch her. Nowadays she lives for pets and lap time, and cuddling with her brother and sister! It's truly a happy ending.
