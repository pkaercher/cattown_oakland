Cat lovers beware, Pepe and Polo are ready for adoption! The 4-year-old bonded brothers have different personalities that complement each other perfectly. Pepe is the more confident and independent of the two, exploring new situations and checking out new people. While he does want his space sometimes, he enjoys being brushed, and at night he'll sleep on his fosters bed — he likes using their leg as a pillow! 
Polo is more on the shy side, but once he settles in and feels safe, he loves to play, and run in and out of his kitty tunnel. He’s very affectionate, taking any opportunity for pets. He'll roll around on the ground, then look up with big lovey eyes hoping for a tummy rub — he'll even touch his foster gently with his paw when he wants scratches. If you're interested in meeting this adorable pair, email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
