We love all cats at Cat Town, but chose a black cat as our logo for a reason: they often struggle to get adopted, and we wanted to change that. In honor of National Black Cat Appreciation Day, we're showing these midnight beauties some extra love. Meet all of our black cats currently looking for homes on our website â€” and if you've adopted a black cat, tell us what makes them special to you!
