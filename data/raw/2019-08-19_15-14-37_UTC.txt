Adopted! Adorable Marni has found her person. She is one of those cats who is beautiful inside and out, and with her sweet meowing conversations, she won over her adopter in no time. Marni has tested positive for FIV, but her care only requires that she stays indoors and has any health concerns addressed with care. Thank you for supporting Cat Town as we help cats like Marni find loving homes!
