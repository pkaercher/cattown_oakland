The first line of defense for homeless animals is the city shelter, Oakland Animal Services â€” Oakland's only open intake shelter. Without them, many animals would have no place to turn for help. We want to thank @oaklandanimalservices for their tireless efforts to help every creature in need. It takes a lot of work, and a lot of compassion, to help a homeless animal get ready to be someone's new best friend!
