This #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday we’re hearing from Cat Town Alum Bubba. His adopter recently wrote: "I just wanted to give you guys at Cat Town an update on Bubba since it’s been a couple months, and let y’all know he’s been the best cat ever! WeI love him so much and Bubba loves his new forever home. Bubba has been super vocal and purrs all the time! He has become super snuggly, playful, and loves to sleep on the bed in between us. We are so grateful to have found the perfect cat for us!" We're so delighted that Bubba found his happily ever after.
