We're in the height of kitten season, and it's the perfect time to learn how to help the community cats in your neighborhood! If you've ever considered getting involved in TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) work, join us for a hands-on training with various traps hosted by @feralchange and @catmanofwestoakland, Adam Myatt. Registration is free with a donation to Feral Change at the door: bit.ly/cattownreserve
