Describe your perfect cat. If it includes the words affectionate, cuddly and companionable, then Lily might be the cat you've always wanted in your life! She adores curling up on your chest while you read in bed, and even hugs you with both paws on your neck. Lily just wants to be around you. She does live with FIV, but that can be managed â€” we do recommend she finds a forever home with an experienced cat owner. Interested in adopting this genuinely friendly cat with the cutest face? Send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org to meet her.
