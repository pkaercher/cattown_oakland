We are delighted to have been selected as Nonprofit of the Month by @brokeassstuart â€” in this brand new series, Broke Ass Stuart will be highlighting smaller Bay Area nonprofits. Writer Geri Koeppel has written a great profile on Cat Town, which you can read at https://brokeassstuart.com/2019/08/16/cat-town-the-no-kill-shelter-saving-thousands-of-kitties/ Weâ€™re grateful for the feature! Thank you!
