Peekaboo! Who's that? It's Olive! This adorable and imaginative 2-year-old is a watcher cat — at first she needs a nice hideout to feel safe in while she investigates new people. But once you let her discover just how great you are, she will come out chirping and purring! Olive often sits on the couch with her fosters, and will follow them into the bedroom when it’s time to sleep. She would love a confident cat friend to shadow and snuggle with, so we’d like to see her go home to another friendly feline! If you're looking to add a second cat to your house, then Olive might be just be the gal for you — email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet her.
