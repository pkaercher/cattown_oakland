Happy National Dog Day! While we are all about helping Oakland's cats find homes, there is one very special dog without whom we couldn't do everything we do: Maddie from @maddiesfund! #ThankstoMaddie, Cat Town's Adoption Center's Studios, our 'In It For Life' program, and our Maddie’s® Medical Manager can all help Oakland's most vulnerable cats. We are grateful for this incredible support!
