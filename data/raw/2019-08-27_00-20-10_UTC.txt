Have you adopted from Cat Town? How has your cat changed your life? Tell us your story! In just 500 words or less, you can help us receive up to $125,000 in grants to save more shelter cats at risk of euthanasia â€” and you can also win a shopping spree for yourself! All this is possible through the @petcofoundation Holiday Wishes Campaign. Every adoption story shared is another chance to receive a lifesaving grant.
.
We hope you'll share your story with the Petco Foundation *** even if you've told your story before***. The deadline is Monday, September 23rd, 10AM PST, but only the first 10,000 stories will be considered. Submit your story at petcofoundation.org/holiday-wishes
