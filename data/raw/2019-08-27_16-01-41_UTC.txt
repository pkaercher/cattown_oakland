Did you see Cat Town's August Volunteer of the Month? It's the amazing team at @clifbar! While the face of Cat Town is our Adoption Center in Downtown Oakland, there is so much that goes on behind the scenes to make the magic happen. One of those things is providing our cats with their most basic needs: food and a litter box. Thatâ€™s where our Volunteer of the Month, Clif Bar, comes in. Their generous employees pick up these supplies from @petfoodexpress every month and deliver them right to our doorstep. Read the full interview with the Clif Bar team at bit.ly/cattownclif
