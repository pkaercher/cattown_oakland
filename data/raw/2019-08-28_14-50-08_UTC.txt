Everyone needs a Yoda in their life â€” a small companion, with a wise and calm presence. If you're looking for your very own Yoda, this sweet Pixie Bob named Yoda might just be the feline friend for you! At 14 years old, he certainly has the wisdom of an older cat, and he just happens to be looking for a home! If you're interested in adopting this friendly senior, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
