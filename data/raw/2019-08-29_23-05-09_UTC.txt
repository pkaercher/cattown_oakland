It's back to school already â€” where has the summer gone? We've been so busy finding homes for all of our cats and kittens that some of our supplies are running low (especially probiotics). If you want to help, consider adding an item from our @amazon wish list to your cart while you finish up your late summer shopping. Our cats thank you! bit.ly/wishlistcattown
