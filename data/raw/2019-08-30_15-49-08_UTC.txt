SOS! We need more fosters as soon as possible — the Oakland city shelter has run out of empty cages, so cats 👏 need 👏 out 👏! The good news is: you can help in a big way by adopting or becoming a foster for Cat Town. Please let us know if you have any space in your home for: Roger, Dante, Leda & Castor, or Charlie Chaplin. You can be a hero for cats in urgent need of intervention, and we'll support you every step of the way. Please email us at info@cattownoakland.org to help!
