In case you missed it in our Stories, SUNNY GOT ADOPTED! According to her foster-turned-adopter: "She convinced us she was already home — and it wasn’t very hard to convince us! She just keeps getting sweeter and sweeter." Sunny’s back legs are slightly weak due to a possible neurological issue, so we are utterly thrilled that she's landed a family who knows exactly what she needs to be happy. If you want to add a little sunshine to your life, check out all of our adoptable cats at cattownoakland.org! Glamor shot by @Lesliewprice
