September is Happy Cat Month! This month is a great time to think about all the things that make your cat happy â€” consider when you've taken your cat to the vet the last time, what you're feeding them, or how much TLC and play time your furry friend(s) receive. Or maybe you're considering adding another cat to your home, because yours would be happier with a feline friend? Whatever it is, we hope you can celebrate a month of cat happiness!
