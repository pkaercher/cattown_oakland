We need help with a critical surgery for foster cat Bruno! His foster reported a big change in his behavior a couple days ago: he was trying to hide, growling and howling. He also stopped using his back legs. It turns out that sweet, cuddly Bruno had an old injury flare up, and while we have him on medication for his intense pain, he desperately needs surgery to fix his left hip. It will cost $2,000 to repair Brunoâ€™s shattered hip-joint, and he may also need some teeth extracted before he can feel like himself. Can you help us with the care he needs? Anything you can contribute helps!
