We hope you had a wonderfully relaxing Labor Day weekend, just like Boy George here in the arms of his adopter! It's been a banner weekend at Cat Town with double digit adoptions â€” we're thrilled to start out the new month like this. Thank you for giving so many cats a loving home, and supporting Oakland's most vulnerable cats in all the ways that you do!
