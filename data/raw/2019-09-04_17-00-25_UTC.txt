What if you could support shelter cats in need of their second chance while soaking up the beauty of Mendocino’s redwood forests, and sleeping soundly in a luxuriously appointed tent at @mendocino_grove? The silent auction at Second Chance Soirée is the perfect way to do just that. Coastal bluffs, beaches, meadows. Saving cats, second chances, finding homes — it can all happen when you treat yourself to Cat Town's fundraising gala in Oakland's beautiful @preservationpark on October 5th. Join us for this extraordinary evening! Get your tickets at bit.ly/cattownscs2019
