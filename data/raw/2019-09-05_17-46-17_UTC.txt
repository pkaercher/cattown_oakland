Two days ago we asked for your help with Bruno's critical surgery â€” and you not only stepped up to help, but exceeded our expectations! Thank you for jumping in when help was needed most! Thanks to you, we have raised enough funds for Bruno, and tomorrow he is having surgery to fix his broken hip, and relieve him from his intense pain. Any additional funds donated go towards our Emergency Medical Fund, so that next time we have an urgent medical situation, we can again step in and help right away.
