THANK YOU to everyone who has helped spread the word about our urgent call for fosters. You truly are our heroes! With your help, we've found fosters or adopters for Roger, Charlie, Leda and Castor, and Dante â€” and we've been able to pull 4 new cats and 5 kittens in need from shelter cages, with more on the way. For every new foster we get, we can help get a shelter kitten out of a cage. Thank you for all of your support! Because of you, we'll be helping more Forgotten Kittens build their confidence!
