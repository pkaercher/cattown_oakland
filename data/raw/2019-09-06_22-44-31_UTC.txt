Are you looking to adopt a cat this month? Our friends at @animal.biome are sponsoring our adoption fees for the month of September! A healthy inside leads to a healthy outside â€” that is true for the microbiome of our pets, as well as the runnings of a nonprofit. So we are extremely lucky to have the support of AnimalBiome this month to make more adoptions happen. If you'd like to double your impact, you can still choose to match the adoption fee when you adopt your special feline. Thank you, AnimalBiome, for helping cats find homes this September!
