In just 500 words, your Cat Town adoption story can help us save more shelter cats! How has your cat changed your life? Whether they’ve made you feel loved by greeting you after a long hard day, or given you a brighter perspective to help you face the day, our cats can make a huge impact on our lives — and we always love hearing updates on our Cat Town alums.
.
By submitting your story NOW, you can help us receive a $100,000 grant to save more shelter cats at risk of euthanasia — while winning a shopping spree for yourself — through @petcofoundation's Holiday Wishes Campaign!
.
🐈 Every adoption story shared is another chance to receive a lifesaving grant. 🐈 
This year, the organization with the most entries can even earn a bonus $25,000 grant. For this reason, we hope you'll share your story with the Petco Foundation, *even if you've told your story before*. The deadline is Monday, September 23rd at noon CST (10AM PST), but only the first 10,000 stories will be considered. Email us at info@cattownoakland.org if you have any questions, and submit your story directly at petcofoundation.org/holiday-wishes/ Thank you!
