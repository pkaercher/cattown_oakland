Do you have stars in your eyes? That’s to be expected when you first see Andromeda! This green-eyed tortie girl — named after the Andromeda Galaxy — is truly out of this world! She is a wonderful, even-tempered companion who loves a good cuddle with her person. Every night, she’ll jump into your lap to binge watch your favorite TV shows, as long as she can get a belly rub or two. That’s easy, fun multi-tasking! According to her foster mom, a loud noise will send Andromeda running for cover, but always ready to play, you can coax her out with her favorite toy. Andromeda will patiently stalk her ribbon toy until you whip it across the room at top speed. That’s when she makes her move — one small step for man, one giant leap for this petite cat! If you're looking for a sweet-natured cat, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet this lovely Andromeda!
