Sweet little Cheyenne got herself adopted this past weekend, but don't despair â€” if you're looking for your own feline best friend, you can find Cat Town at the @bayareapetfair this coming weekend, September 14-15! It's not only the largest adopt-a-thon in the United States, it's also brought to you by the amazing folks at @petfoodexpress. This yearâ€™s goal is to find homes for 2,000 animals! There will be classes and workshops, many rescues and shelters such as @milodogsandcats @houserabbitsociety and @oaklandanimalservices, food trucks, and special guests @animalbrandon and @thecatdaddy. Finally, just when you thought this doesn't get any better: the Bay Area Pet Fair has free admission and free parking! Learn more at bayareapetfair.org
