We're happy to share that Bruno's surgery went well, and he's now happily recovering in the comfort of his foster home! Thank you again to everyone who donated to his surgery â€” because of you, we were able to give him the urgent medical care he needed, help him on his way to recovery, and his journey to find a home!
