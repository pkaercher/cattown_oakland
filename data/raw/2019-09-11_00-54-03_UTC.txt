Resilience. That's what we need at Cat Town to do the work we do every day, helping the cats that have no other option. Resilience is also a delicious draft beer, made locally at Gilman Brewing. We are delighted that @gilmanbrewing will be serving their handcrafted beer at Second Chance SoirÃ©e! That's just one of many reasons to join us for our special evening on October 5. Get your tickets now before they sell out! Link in bio.
