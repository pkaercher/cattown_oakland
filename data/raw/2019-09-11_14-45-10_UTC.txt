Thank you to everyone who voted in our T-shirt contest — it was a very close race, but WE HAVE OURSELVES A WINNER! Congratulations to Niki Waters @kneesandkeysart and her winning design of the Oakland graffiti cats! We're so excited to be printing her fantastic illustration on our newest Cat Town T-shirt, which will debut at Second Chance Soirée on October 5th at @preservationpark! If you want to be one of the first to get Cat Town's awesome new T-shirt, make sure to secure your tickets to this special evening — helping Oakland's cats who need it most!.

Thank you to everyone who voted for your enthusiasm! And thank you to all artists who participated, especially our finalists @alegra_figeroid and @hanaekoart — we couldn't have been happier with the wonderful designs you submitted! You made everyone's decision very hard, in the best of ways.
