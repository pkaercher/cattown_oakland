#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Sweet Pebbles found her home just last month, and is doing wonderfully in her new home! She is now named Pepper and is adored by adopters. "She had a fairly quick transition, she was fully exploring our whole apartment within 3 days of bringing her home. She’s so sweet and PLAYFUL! We’ve learned quickly that she really loves and needs play time. She especially wants to play at 1am each night! We love her and feel so lucky to have her." Here she is playing in her tunnel!
