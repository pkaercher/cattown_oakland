We all need purr machines and professional cuddlers in our life — beautiful Celeste can provide just that. She is a lovely and attentive cat that might start off a bit shy, but quickly shows her true colors after getting comfortable. Once she settles in, she'll be purring constantly and begging for head scratches. Celeste also loves to play, and has even learned some tricks from her foster — that's how smart she is. Celeste is hyperthyroid, so will need a quiet home, but if this wonderfully loving and affectionate cat will make the ideal companion. If you're looking to receive more feline headbutts in your life, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet Celeste!
