Can you foster Fanny? Fanny just had kittens, which she has successfully raised to their adoptable age â€” now she's ready for the next chapter in her life outside of the shelter. This adorable girl needs a foster home where she can be an only cat, and get all the TLC to herself! Fostering is easy: we deliver the cat and all the necessary supplies. If you can bring a foster cat into your home, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
