We are thrilled to share a very special adoption with you: our bonded trio, Geneva, Sahara and India, found their home! The three found a wonderful family where they are loved â€” so much so that they now even have their own Instagram account! So if you never want to miss another update from Geneva, Sahara and India, follow them at @three_sister_cats.

When we announced our goal to get our trio adopted by the end of the summer, we knew it was possible, but we also knew that finding a home for three cats all at once wouldn't be easy â€” but you made it happen. Thank you for spreading the word and helping us find a family for them! We couldn't have accomplished our goal without so much support every step of the way.
