You may remember Teddy from our Adoption Center, glancing longingly at you with his big, yellow eyes through his fluffy black fur coat. He is now happily settled in a foster home, ready to find his family! Teddy is a pretty independent guy â€” he likes to be around his people but doesn't require a lot of attention. He'll check in with you by giving head bonks and rubbing his fluffy cheeks on you, then happily settle down nearby to hang out â€” when he's content, he purrs and makes gentle biscuits with his huge fluffy paws. While Teddy is friendly and affectionate, he does need to have his boundaries respected â€“ donâ€™t we all?! He needs to be in control of his petting and that means limiting pets to just a few touches. But this soft, fluffy buddy adapts quickly to new people and environments, making him an ideal, fearless companion! If you want to meet Teddy, email us at Info@cattownoakland.org.
