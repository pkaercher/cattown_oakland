We placed sweet senior Reina in a foster home exactly one week ago! Thank you again to everyone who stepped up to foster cats who need our help, and spread the word of our urgent need! Because of you, we are able to pull more cats from the shelter, and help them find loving homes. Late summer is always a hard time of year, but this year is especially hard â€” that means that we are stretching ourselves to take still more foster cats. Thank you for supporting us as we do so!
