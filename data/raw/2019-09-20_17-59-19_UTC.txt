Only 3 days left to submit your Cat Town adoption story! In just 500 words or less, your story can help us receive a grant for up to $125,000 through @petcofoundation‘s Holiday Wishes Campaign — and save more shelter cats! How has your cat changed your life? How have they made your life brighter? 🐈 Every adoption story shared is another chance to receive a lifesaving grant. 🐈 We hope you'll share your story with the Petco Foundation, even if you've told your story before. The deadline is Monday, September 23rd at noon CST (10AM PST). Send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org if you have any questions, or submit your story directly at petcofoundation.org/holiday-wishes/
