There's an incredible event happening on October 5th in San Francisco â€” the Feline Science Symposium â€” where our very own Ann Dunn is going be presenting! The event is hosted by @sanfranciscospca, and will have a fantastic line up of experts speaking about cat behavior and welfare. We're excited for the opportunity to share findings of our Forgotten Kitten Project â€” including how we socialize older, fearful kittens to get them adopted!
