Happy Caturday! Are you missing a little sweetness in your life? It could be because you havenâ€™t met Molly yet. This senior lady is a puddle of love and will follow you everywhere! Molly loves being treated like the princess she is, and one of her favorite things is to have a luxurious brushing. She likes to flop over to show her appreciation! Molly does have some special needs, as she has intermittent stomach issues, but daily brushing and a probiotic with her meals seem to have done the trick and helped her feel healthy! We think this special lady would be most successful in a loving, calm environment with plenty of attention and lots of patience. She might even enjoy some yard access, since she seems interested in going outdoors. If you're interested in adopting Molly, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
