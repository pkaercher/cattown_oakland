On #SeniorCatSunday, Whisper wants the world to know that she is still available for adoption! Whisper's hobbies include being brushed, rubbing against you, and catching toys. But her favorite thing in the world is definitely being brushed. Whisper's companionable personality and affectionate nature shine through during these moments. As with most older cats, sheâ€™s independent and knows what she likes and doesnâ€™t like. But while she enjoys her personal space and a nice quiet environment, she also loves laying on top of people when they watch television. If you're interested in meeting this adorable senior lady, email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
