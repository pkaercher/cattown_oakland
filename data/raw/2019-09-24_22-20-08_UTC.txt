Meet our Cat of the Month, sweet orange tabby  Jax! His favorite activity is rubbing up against things, whether they are your personal possessions, your legs, or anything else that provides him warmth and a nice scratch — he simply wants to be close to the things he loves most. Jax is an all around fun feline fellow looking for someone to headbutt against forever. Maybe it’s you? If you adopt Jax in September, his adoption fee will even be sponsored by @animal.biome!  If you’d like to bring Jax into your life, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
