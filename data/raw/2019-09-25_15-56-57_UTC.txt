Cat Town's party of the year is only 10 days away! Will you be there? Apart from cat themed games and delicious libations, we have some seriously ameowzing auction items that money can't buy â€” except at Second Chance SoirÃ©e of course. One such item is a dinner with our founder Ann Dunn, @joyfulvegan Colleen Patrick-Gourdreau and Dr. Jennifer Conrad from @pawproject. A chance like that only comes around once every cat life. Pre-bidding opens soon, and October 4th will be the last day to get tickets online! How do you get tickets? Go to the link in our bio!
