Cyan is looking for a foster! This beautiful 3-year-old boy is feeling stressed and conflicted in a cage, so we're hoping to get him into a foster home with someone who has experience with cats. Fostering is easy â€” if you have some space in your home, that's really all you need. We'll bring Cyan to you, along with all of the supplies you need! If you think you can help by fostering Cyan or another cat, reach out to us by emailing info@cattownoakland.org.
