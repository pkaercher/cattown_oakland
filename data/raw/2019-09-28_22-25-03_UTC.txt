Etta loves playtime, especially her cat dancer! She'll roll around trying to grab it, sit under the bed and try to pull it under like some kind of fuzzy monster, or just chase it around trying to capture and eat it. When this beautiful lady isn't playing with her favorite toy, she’s eagerly accepting any and all love she can get. If you offer her some pets, she’ll be content for hours by your side! Etta is also very curious — this trait helps the 8-year-old come out of her shell, as she’s a little nervous at times. She's so excited to join a home! If you're ready to give her all the affection and attention she deserves, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet her.
