Button was brought into @oaklandanimalservices as a stray with matted fur. Because she wasn't using the box at the shelter, she was considered unadoptable by most standards.
.
Cat Town brought Button into a foster home, and got her diagnosed with asthma, severe arthritis, and a urinary tract infection. Thanks to our donor-supported Emergency Medical Fund, this sweet senior is doing much better — and while not perfect, her litter box skills have already improved dramatically.
.
We couldn't do this work without the incredible support from our community. Every donation, no matter how small. Every foster willing to help a sweet senior cat with complicated medical issues. Every kind, supportive word makes these stories happen.
.
We're not sure where Button's story will go — but by helping cats like her, we never wonder if we could have done more. She is currently looking for an adopter. If you'd like to help Button on her journey, please email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
