Poppy came to Cat Town upset and withdrawn, with old injuries causing her a lot of pain. An all black cat, Poppy also had 1 single white whisker. Now that her pain is being managed, she’s gained so much confidence that she even asks for pets! She’s also lost her white whisker. We are so proud of her progress, and her white whisker commemorates her incredible transformation — which is why Poppy's special whisker will be available at our silent auction at Second Chance Soirée! As a symbol of Poppy's transformation, and Cat Town’s mission of #transformingcatrescuenationwide, you can not only add this whisker to your collection, but at the same time help more cats like Poppy!
