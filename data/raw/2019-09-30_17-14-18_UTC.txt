Sebastian is wondering, are you his adopter? This gentle, sweet guy is easy to love, says his foster mom. In fact, his winning and funny personality has even managed to win over her dog-loving husband! Sebastian wants nothing more than to be petted and to eat — those are his main objectives in life. He wants to be near you, and will sit on the couch with you and happily accept pets for ages and ages, purring the entire time. This young tabby can be a little skittish when he hears a loud noise, but his confidence has grown by leaps and bounds, and he is friendly with new people. Given he’s such companionable cat, we think Sebastian would be fine with a first-time adopter and in a home with older children — as long as they promise to pet him!
