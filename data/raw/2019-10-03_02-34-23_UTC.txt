Is Clarissa wearing mittens? It sure looks like she is, but this playful and outgoing cat has polydactyl paws â€” which look like mittens! Clarissa also has a fun personality to match. She loves to play, especially with her people, and her foster says that she's got "a very specific look when she is ready." Clarissa also loves to be pet and enjoys morning and evening snuggles. If you're thinking you need this cute and confident girl in your life, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet her!
