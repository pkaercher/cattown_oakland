Whatâ€™s better than coffee and a cookie in the afternoon? You can get it all, at Cat Town. Cat Zone resident Cookie is just like her name implies â€“ so very sweet. Sheâ€™s currently the mom of the Cat Zone, and is frequently seen in a cuddle puddle with one of her feline Cat Zone friends! If you want to meet her, come on over to our Adoption Center, and grab a coffee at RAWR coffee bar @eatlikealion on on your way in. Just keep in mind weâ€™ll be closing early this Saturday for our Second Chance SoirÃ©e! To secure your spot at Cat Town in advance, go to bit.ly/cattownreserve
