We are so honored to have the fantastic supporters we do, because without you, last night would not have been nearly as much fun! Yes, our Second Chance SoirÃ©e featured exciting games, and delicious food and drinks â€” but more importantly it featured you, the best company we could ask for. Thank  you for helping us raise more than $60,000 to help even more cats in need! Thank you to everyone who showed up, to all of you who bid in our silent auction, and to the hard working volunteers who made this very special evening possible. We know we are lucky to get to do what we do â€” save the cats who need us most â€” and we could not feel more gratitude.
