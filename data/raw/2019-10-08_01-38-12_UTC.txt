For those of you who attended Second Chance Soirée, you might remember Waffles! She was at the @oaklandanimalservices, hiding in her litter box after being surrendered from a home. She was stressed, and needed help. Thanks to your incredible support, we brought her to Cat Town yesterday! She’s already walking around her new studio, and starting to relax. Thank you to everyone who was at Second Chance Soirée, and for making sure we could give Waffles the space she needed to feel like herself again!
