Come chillax and meditate with cats on Thursday, October 17th! Join us for iRest Yoga Nidra, a guided body-sensing meditation delivered while you sit comfortably, surrounded by fuzz in the Cat Zone. iRest invites you into that nourishing, restorative space between waking and dreaming â€” cats LOVE the soothing vibe and might just come closer to check on us, or sprawl out nearby. Instructor Jaene Leonard has been leading iRest Meditation with humans, dogs, and cats in and around the Bay Area for eight years â€” so come on over to meditate and vibrate at that perfect kitty frequency. Go to bit.ly/cattownreserve to reserve your spot.
