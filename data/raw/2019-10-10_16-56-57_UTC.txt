We have more cats in our care than ever before â€” about 70 of them are in foster care alone, and another 35 cats are at our Adoption Center! With so many cats at Cat Town, we want to make sure we are prepared for any emergencies, and we currently need an additional 20 carriers for our cats. Can you help us by adding a carrier to your next amazon shopping spree from Cat Town's amazon wishlist? If you can help, go to bit.ly/cattownwish to see Cat Town's wishlist. Thank you!
