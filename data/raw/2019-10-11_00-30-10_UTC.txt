Meet Pippa! Full of energy and sweetness, this young lady is on the hunt for her forever home. Once Pippa gets to know you, she graciously accepts pets, and is very affectionate — she likes to nuzzle up close to your face when she sits on your lap. When you pet her, she'll sometimes share a cute little squawk, as if to say 'Oh hi! Thanks!'. Pippa is an active cat, who needs an adopter who is committed to having 15-30 minute play sessions with her several times per day. The good thing is, she loves to play fetch, and she’s obsessed with chasing and batting things around — hair ties seem to be her favorite. Her foster parents say that if you throw a hair tie up on a windowsill or table, Pippa will jump up, grab it in her mouth, and bring it back to you so you can throw it again. If you're interesting in adopting this loving young cat, send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org. .
