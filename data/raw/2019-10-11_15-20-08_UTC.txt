Did you know that feral cats can be fantastic for rodent control? Throughout Oakland and Northern California, feral cats from our friends at @oaklandanimalservices are hard at work â€” and OAS has just placed their 200th cat through their "Cats On Patrol" program. They pair feral cats that have no other options with adopters looking for rodent control. Johnny is one of the working cats in the colony that lives on site at Oakland Animal Services. If you want to save the life of a cat with nowhere else to go, or need incredibly cute feline rodent control of your own, this might be the perfect solution for you.
