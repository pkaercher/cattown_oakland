Sometimes all it takes for a cat to feel like themselves again is getting out of a cage. Avery was feeling stressed at the shelter — we could tell she was sweet and gentle at heart, but she felt overwhelmed in a cage, especially after being at the shelter for 2 months. We placed her in a foster home yesterday, and here she is exploring her new queendom! Thank you for helping us give cats like Avery a second chance — Cat Town couldn't do what we do without the support of our amazing network of foster guardians!
