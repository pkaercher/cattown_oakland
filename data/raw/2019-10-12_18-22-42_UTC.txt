Want to learn how to move with the grace and confidence of a cat? Join @kravmagaoakland for a womenâ€™s self-defense seminar on October 19th! The 90-minute class will leave you feeling empowered and more confident, with life-saving physical and psychological skills that can be used immediately. All experience levels are welcome! This class will be taught by lead instructor and owner, Dany Zelig. And best of all, Tactica Krav Maga Institute is generously donating 100% of the proceeds to Cat Town, so we can help more cats!
