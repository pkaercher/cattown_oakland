This is Betty. Since it's #SeniorCatSunday, we thought it's time you meet her. Betty is a shy girl who’s actually a big goofball once you get to know her! She just makes you earn it. Betty is a big fan of rolling around on the floor when she’s feeling energetic, and likes to switch it up between getting belly rubs and playing with a toy — her toy of choice at the moment is the stick part of a wand toy. Her foster parent shares that if you try to approach Betty on your own, or try to get her to go somewhere specific, she probably won’t be into it, but when she wants your attention, she’ll let you know! Who doesn’t like a lady who knows what she wants? She's also chatty, and loves to have conversations with you, if you feel like meowing back to her. To meet Betty, just email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
