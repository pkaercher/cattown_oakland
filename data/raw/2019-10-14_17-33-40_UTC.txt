Spike was at the shelter for over two months before he came to Cat Town. This affectionate "lion" just didn't find his people there, but we're hoping his adopters will come for him soon! He's now in a foster home where he greets his guardian at the front door when she arrives home. Spike loves to be near you, and always finds his place next to you whether youâ€™re sitting on the couch or lying in bed. He wants you to know he is never far away!
