This #TransformationTuesday the spotlight falls on sibling pair Sally and Charlie! They used to be quite shy, and needed some time to get comfortable with new places and people before emerging from their shell. But recently they've been a lot more brave — here is Sally greeting a visitor in her foster home. We're so happy to see this transformation! Thanks to you, Sally and Charlie got the time they needed to decompress outside of a cage, and blossom into the cats they are today. Sally and Charlie are still looking for their forever home, so if you’d like to meet these two precious goofballs, email info@cattownoakland.org.
