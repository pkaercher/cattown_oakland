It's been feeling a lot like fall lately â€” the perfect time to turn your focus inwards, wind down and relax after a busy summer season. Join us for Yoga Nidra in the Cat Zone this Thursday. Relax with our cats during a guided body-sensing meditation, as instructor Jaene Leonard invites you into that nourishing, restorative space between waking and dreaming. Then next Thursday, October 24th, you can join us again for Mindful Yoga at Cat Town with instructor Sarah Woods LaDue. Go to bit.ly/cattownreserve to reserve your spot, or follow the link in our bio.
