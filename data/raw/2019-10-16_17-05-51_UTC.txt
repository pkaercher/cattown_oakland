Our favorite moment is always when a cat gets adopted. A close second is hearing how well a cat is doing in their new home! We recently got this heartwarming update from Oz's adopter: "Oz is doing very well and has quickly become the center of our household. He is a good shadow kitty and likes following us around (especially in the kitchen, where the food is). He meows soulfully when he wants attention, and is training me very well to respond to that! He has a new cat tree, which he loves scratching and climbing up so he can look out the window. He is becoming more comfortable hanging out with us on the couch, especially if we put a bird video on the iPad for him. He LOVES bird videos. He still loves his hunting games and enjoys chasing the cat dancer or his soccer ball. He’s getting more cuddly though, and starting to really enjoy long belly rubs and head scratches. I’m really, really happy I adopted him. He’s a wonderful companion and has brought a lot of extra warmth and fun into our home." Happy #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday!
