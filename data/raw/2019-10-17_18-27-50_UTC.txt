We’d never claim Prometheus is descended from the (cat) gods, but we won't deny it, either. He is a very handsome, affectionate and confident guy, and wants nothing more than to be your best buddy. Prometheus loves to snuggle, especially if you treat him to his favorite chin and neck scratches — he'll respond with constant purring, the deep rumbly kind. Prometheus also has a ton of energy and enjoys spending time outside. If you have outdoor space where he can run around, he’d be thrilled! Prometheus would be happiest in a home where his people are home quite a bit — he likes it when there aren't big gaps in how often he gets those chin scratches. And once you hear his purr we bet you won’t want to go too long without being near him either. Want to meet this friendly fellow? Email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
