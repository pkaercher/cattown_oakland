Are you big-hearted, patient and want to help save a life? Maybe you can help Gilman â€” he needs a foster home! He was attacked by a dog, is in a lot of pain, and he needs a small, quiet space where he can rest and heal. He would much rather spend time with you than be in a cage while he recovers from his injuries. To learn more about fostering Gilman, send an email to info@cattownoakland.org.
