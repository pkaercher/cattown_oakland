Cassidy is not only our Cat of the Month, she's also a true Bay Area foodie. She is always curious about human food smells, and her favorite snack is ‘Party Mix’ cat treats. This affectionate girl wants your attention, wants to be near you, and isn’t shy about asking for that love. Her foster reports that she will even go so far as to put her paw gently on your lap to remind you to keep petting her. Sometimes she will even “steal” her fosters’ spot whenever they get up from the couch. Appearing to be a wallflower at first, It can take this gentle tuxedo a few days or so for her to really warm up to new people, but once she does, this affectionate cat will love playing, snuggling and napping on your lap. Cassidy is hoping to find her very own home soon, so if you're interested in meeting her, just send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org!
