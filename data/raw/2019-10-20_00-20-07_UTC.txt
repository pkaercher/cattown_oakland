Have yourself an adorable purrito! Fluffy Luneau was found in a Mexican restaurant in East Oakland, and brought to @oaklandanimalservices. Now she's in a foster home and patiently waiting to find a family. If you want this sweet ball of fluff in your life, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet Luneau.
