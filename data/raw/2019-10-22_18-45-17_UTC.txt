Time flies! Second Chance SoirÃ©e was already more than two weeks ago â€” but we're still bathing in the warm and fuzzy feeling of love and support we received from our community. Because you care about Oakland's most vulnerable cats, we are able to do this life-saving work. You make it all possible. We're so happy we got to spend a fun-filled evening with you all!
