Can you believe Yoda hasn't found a home yet? According to his foster mom, Yoda is an 'old, gentle soul'. He just wants to know you're there and close, and he'll spend the whole day keeping you company. Yoda will even offer guidance when you pet him by tilting his head and waiting patiently until you find just the right spots. If you'd like this sweet senior Pixie-Bob in your life, send us a message at info@cattownoakland.org.
