Our Adoption Center is turning 5 years old today! With your support, we opened America’s first cat cafe on October 25, 2014. In 5 short years, thousands of “unadoptable” cats were able to show who they really are in our care. It’s been 5 years of making scared kittens brave, and helping sick cats heal. For 5 years, we've been finding homes for friendly senior cats who sat in everyone’s lap, because they finally felt safe. This anniversary we’re celebrating every cat who beat the odds, met hundreds of friendly visitors, and found a loving home! Today, we'll hope you’ll join us by making a $5 donation to help the next cats in need! Link in bio.
