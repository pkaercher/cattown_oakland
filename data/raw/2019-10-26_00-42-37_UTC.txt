It's #FosterFriday! Can you believe Mini has been in our care for over a year? She has been so very patient in waiting to find her family, so we hope that she'll find her special person soon. In the meantime, while she's waiting for them to come find her, we need to move Mini to a new foster home. If you can foster this quirky senior lady (who loves nighttime cuddles by the way) send an email to info@cattownoakland.org.
