We're happy to report that thanks to you Bruno is doing great â€” he's recovered from his surgery and is walking again! And in even better news, he's officially ready for adoption. When we first brought Bruno from the shelter into a foster home he was facing several medical challenges. As a senior, he didn't have many options, but with your support we were able to give him the treatment he needed. Thanks to you, we didn't have to think twice about whether we could perform the urgent surgery needed to relieve him from his pain. These days Bruno is an "amazing purring machine" according to his foster mom, affectionate and super loving. With his wonderful personality and good looks, he might just sweep you off your feet. To meet Bruno, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
