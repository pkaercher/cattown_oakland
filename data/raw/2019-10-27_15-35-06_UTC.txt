#SeniorCatSunday: Bee Bee came to the shelter missing one eye, and not much vision in the other — But this sweet senior has not lost her zest for life. She's a purr machine, a total sweetheart, has the cutest raspy little mews, and is always ready and eager to climb underneath blankets for cuddles. Despite her impaired vision, Bee Bee seems to be able to quickly navigate a room, but she absolutely needs to be an indoor only cat. This sweet senior lady is both independent and companionable, making her a great addition to any household. If you’re looking for a friendly and confident senior friend, consider adopting Bee Bee. Email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet her!
