With adorable sister pair Becca and Bindi you can have two of everything â€” twice the fun, love, and soft fur. Of the two, Becca is more outgoing and enjoys soaking up your attention. She is protective of her sister Bindi who is more shy, but both have the cutest meows with which they love to greet their foster parent. This gentle 4 year old pair is looking for a comfortable home with a patient adopter, who will take the time to get to know them both in their own time. If you'd like to meet these two sweet calicos, send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org.
