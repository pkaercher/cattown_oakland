Happy #NationalCatDay! Today we are celebrating all the wonderful cats in our lives â€” whether it's cats who were surrendered to the shelter feeling scared after losing their person, senior cats who need a second chance and additional medical care, or Forgotten Kittens who didn't get the socialization they needed when they were young, and are learning to be confident around humans as older kittens. Thanks to you, those are the cats that Cat Town is able to help. So give your cat a squeeze and treats on this special day to honor and celebrate who they are!
