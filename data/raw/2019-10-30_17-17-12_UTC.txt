#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: When Andromeda first came to the shelter, she was feeling stressed and withdrawn after just losing her home of 8 years. We brought her to our Adoption Center where she could decompress, giving her the time she needed to feel ready for pets and attention â€” which after a few weeks, she did. After some time we moved her to a foster home so she could feel the comfort of a home again, and get one on one attention. Not long after, gentle and sweet Andromeda was adopted! Her adopter sent us a photo update recently, and let us know that her attention-seeking side is emerging and her personality is starting to shine, which brought a big smile to our face! Knowing her journey makes these updates all the more special.
