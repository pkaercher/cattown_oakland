When Teddy came to Cat Town he got the nick name "Tidy Teddy" â€” his toys were always neatly stored in one corner of the room, and he never tracked the litter from his box. Teddy is now in a foster home with @felinefellow, where he has already gone on his first supervised walk outside, and his foster is clicker training him. This smart, fluffy feline is learning to ring a bell to get treats! Overall, Teddy is a pretty independent guy. He likes to be around his people but doesn't need a lot of attention â€” he'll check in with you by giving head bonks and rubbing his fluffy cheeks on you, then happily settle down nearby to hang out. If you're interested in adopting this little house panther, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
