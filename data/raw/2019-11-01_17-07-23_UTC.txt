With so many fires burning in California, shelters across the state are feeling the additional strain of animals needing immediate care and attention. If you're interested in helping, here are some things that you can do:
1) Adopt from @oaklandanimalservices. Many animals rescued in Napa and Sonoma will be transferred to partners nearby, which means that OAS will be filling up quickly. By adoptiing directly from OAS you are emptying a cage â€” the more space the shelter has, the more additional animals can be rescued and taken in.
2) Foster. Reach out to your local shelter or nonprofit to inquire about fostering animals in need. Any additional space in a home will help rescues take in more homeless pets!
3) Donate. Donating to your local shelter or rescue organization can help them give the support needed in the community during this challenging time. Your local rescues will know what resources are needed where, so give right where it's needed most.
Our hearts go out to all those affected by the fires and evacuation â€” we hope you and your pets stay safe and can go home soon!
