Watson and Cricket are currently working on their newest scientific study: how long will it take for a fluffy, soft lap cat and his adorable, goofy sidekick to find a home? So far the research study is set up for success â€” the test subjects (Watson and Cricket themselves) have deep, soothing purrs and cute, little meows. They enjoy sitting in boxes and like being around humans. They also love to play and enjoy social grooming. They can be a bit shy with new people, but they're hoping this fact won't deter any possible research participants. If you think you might be able to assist them in their process and give these two boys a loving home, send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org!
