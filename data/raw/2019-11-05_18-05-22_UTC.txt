Kitten season isn't over! One of the most effective ways to help prevent the shelter from overflowing with kittens during the summer is TNR â€” Trap-Neuter-Return. This technique helps prevent homeless kittens from being born while ensuring adult cats get the care they need. You can learn all about TNR at our free workshop tomorrow! The event will be hosted by @feralchange! Donations to Feral Change at the door will support the tireless TNR work of Feral Change. Reserve your space now at bit.ly/cattownreserve
