Anna lost her home after being surrendered to the shelter, and was stressed in a cage. Once she came to Cat Town, she  quickly became the resident lap cat at our Adoption Center, charming visitors left and right. When Anna made herself at home in her adopter’s lap, it was all over. Anna didn't even move when it came time to sign the paperwork — she stayed put on the warm lap, overseeing the whole process. This lucky lady is going to be doted on by her new mom! Congratulations to Anna and her person on finding each other!
