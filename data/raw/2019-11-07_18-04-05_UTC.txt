Remember gentle senior Waffles? At the shelter, Waffles was terrified after being surrendered from a home, and was hiding in her litter box. Thanks to your support, we brought the 11-year-old to our Adoption Center, where she started to relax and accepted pets. We're happy to report that this past week Waffles was adopted! Thank you for helping us give her that second chance  at finding a family to love.
