Anansi is now ready for adoption! This sweet boy was quite shy at the shelter. When he came to Cat Town, he was able to learn from more confident cats how fun and rewarding it is to interact with humans, making him more brave every day. Now he's ready to find his family. You can meet him and all of the cats at our Adoption Center today!
