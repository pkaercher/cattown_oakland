November is Adopt a Senior Pet Month! We currently have 16 seniors in foster care, waiting for their chance to charm their adopter. One such senior is Reina, who so deserves to live out her golden years in a loving home. This sweet girl with irresistible Maine Coon floofs and tabby markings is affectionate and gentle. She is the perfect lap cat, but also loved to engage in playtime. If you‚Äôre interested in meeting Reina or another senior cat, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
