Foster needed! 1-year-old Wonder needs a small space in a calm home without any stairs while we figure out what's going on with her medically. We've ruled out more serious medical conditions such as toxoplasmosis, but want to get her out of the shelter soon so she can be seen by our vet. Fostering is easy â€” we'll deliver Wonder to you along with all the supplies! If you can help this sweet girl, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
