Miles and Monty were adopted this past month — when we heard the news, the whole Cat Town team cheered! The bonded pair made incredible progress in the 6 months they were at our Adoption Center — they transformed from frightened Forgotten Kittens to every cat's best friend, learning a great deal along the way from more confident cats. Here they are meeting their adopter for the first time over coffee! Thanks to you, Miles and Monty got the time they needed to feel comfortable and find a home.
