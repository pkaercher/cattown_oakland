Sweet senior Maddie, named after our friends at @maddiesfund, needs a new foster! She was found in the @oaklandanimalservices parking lot by our Foster Coordinator Dawn. Maddie has arthritis, but she’s a very smart kitty and picks up on your behavior cues — like when it’s time for bed or when you want to just hang out on the sofa. She will eventually jump up next to you, and likes to settle in so that she’s snuggled against you. If you can give her that snuggle time and love while she waits to find her home, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to learn more about fostering Maddie!
