When 10-year old Feather came into the shelter, her fur was matted and patchy from hair loss. She clearly wasn't feeling well after being found as a stray. As a senior, she immediately made it on our radar, and this past weekend we were able to place her in a foster home! On the way there, we stopped at the vet for a check up, and she was a sweetheart throughout the whole process. This gentle and loving flame point siamese will be ready for adoption soon â€” perfect timing for #AdoptASeniorPetMonth!
