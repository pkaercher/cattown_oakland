Cats and Yoga â€” it's that time again! Join us next Thursday, November 21, for Mindful Yoga at our Adoption Center. All you need is your mat and your intention, and instructor Sarah Woods LaDue will invite you to rest in the moment, as you soak up the soothing feline energy. To reserve your spot, go to bit.ly/catttownreserve
