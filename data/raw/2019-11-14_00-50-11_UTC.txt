#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Do you remember adorable Button, who was adopted just a few weeks ago? Well she's doing wonderfully at home with her new found favorite human. They let us know that "Button has a lot of personality and is quite demanding when it comes to wanting affection. She sleeps under the covers either in between my legs or next to my chest and spends the rest of her time either asleep on the couch next to me while I brush her, or waddling over to her food bowl." Button is a senior cat, and that means her adopter has made some adjustments around the house for her â€” she's even made steps for Button to climb up on the couch and bed. Her adopter also says "I do need to wash her bottom as she can't clean herself but she's so calm she's very good with it." We're so happy that, thanks to you, Button found the best possible home to live out her golden years!
