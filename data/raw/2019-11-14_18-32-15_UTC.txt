Sequoia might be a senior, but she's young at heart — just look at the sweet glance in her eyes! She loves playtime, but more than anything, she loves loving you. She gives and receives affection so easily and will gladly do so at any time. Nothing will get in her way of her desire for companionship and daily mission to get as much attention as possible! Due to her health requirements, Sequoia needs to go to a home with an experienced pet guardian, but we think she’d enjoy the company of other felines — so if you’re looking to get an additional cat, Sequoia could be the one! To meet this affectionate senior, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
