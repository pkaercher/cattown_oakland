Foster needed! Mini still needs a new foster home by the end of this month. This senior lady is a little more complicated than your average cat, making up for it with loud purrs and adorable toe floofs. She is diabetic and arthritic, but she's easy to medicate â€” eating is a fantastic distraction in that regard. Mini can be guarded with new people, and it takes her a long time to build trust, but once she gets to know you, she gives you all the love in the world! We're looking for a confident foster guardian who is ready to give Mini a comfortable foster home, and love her just as she is while we find her forever family. If you can help Mini, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
