We have to give a shout out to our friends at @oaklandanimalservices! As an open intake shelter, they work tirelessly to help the animals in their care, no matter how sick or injured. Remember Gilman?  Despite being incredibly understaffed, they got him the medical treatment he needed after he was brought in with terrible injuries. Gilman was able to recover, and got adopted, thanks to their efforts. Weâ€™re thrilled for Gilman, and so glad to work closely with a shelter who is always ready to roll up their sleeves to do everything possible for a happy outcome.
