"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside, I'm not one of those who can easily hide..." That's the song foster cat Elton John was singing to himself when he learned that he's adopted! He's going to a house where he can live with his new found parents and feline sister. As a forgotten kitten, Elton John needed some extra time in a foster home to build his confidence, because he was being overlooked at the shelter. Thanks to your support, heâ€™s now found his forever home!
