Lola is soft, sweet, and knows exactly what she wants in life â€” you! She is not afraid to ask for what her heart desires, and has a wonderfully raspy meow that is sure to melt your heart. This 16-year-old senior gal needs a daily medication, and is an early riser, so if you have experience medicating cats and wish you had someone to describe the sunrise with, come meet Lola at our Adoption Center! Odds are she'll sit in your lap, but she might also hold your hand in her paws and gaze adoringly into your eyes.
