Let it be known, Roger is VERY cute! His foster mom used all caps to describe this young boy, so we thought we would, too. Besides his adorable looks, Roger is also intelligent, independent and companionable â€” he especially loves exploring boxes and bags. Once he gets to know you, he is very trusting, and will follow you everywhere. His foster mom says it's almost like having your own personal security! Roger would do best in a home where he will be intellectually stimulated, and get some good physical workouts, so if you're not only looking for a feline companion, but are also ready for some serious playtime, he might just be the cat for you. Email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet Roger!
