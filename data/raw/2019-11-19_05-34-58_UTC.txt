We are excited to announce our first Cat Town Trivia! Put on your favorite cat attire and come test your cat knowledge at the @thegoodhop on Tuesday, December 3 at 7:30pm, just a few blocks away from Cat Town. Along with fun trivia questions, there will be a contest for best dressed and there are great prizes to be had! Mark your calendars, come solo or bring your friends, and make sure to study your cat facts.
