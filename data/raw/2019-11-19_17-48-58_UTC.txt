We recently had photographer @shuttershelly come to our Adoption Center to photograph our entire team. Thanks to her generous donation of time and skills, you can now see the humans behind Cat Town! She also took some great shots of our Cat Zone cats â€” here's Leopold, adopted back in September, dozing in a cozy cat bed. Thank you Shelly for supporting Cat Town in this meaningful way!
