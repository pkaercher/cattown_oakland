November is Adopt a Senior Pet Month, and we have more than a dozen wonderful senior cats who would love to meet your acquaintance. Cats like Dino, who want to sit in your lap. Cats like Lola, who want to tell you all about their day. Cats like Sequoia, who still love to play, and cats like Whisper, who don't put up with anyone's sass. You can see all of our adoptable senior cats on our website bit.ly/adoptcattown. Helping older cats is core to our work, because after a lifetime of living in a home, they don't do well in a shelter cage. Your support allows us to give them comfort in their golden years. Thank you for believing with us that no matter their age, every cat deserves a home!
