#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Elsa lost her home of 2 years when she was surrendered to OAS. Having lived her whole life in a home, she wasn't feeling like herself in a cage. Thanks to you, we were able to help her find a new home! Her adopter says that "she is settling in SO well — the night that I got her she was already sitting next to me on the couch purring up a storm. She is so social and adorable and friendly! I am already a very overly protective mom and want to make sure she's happy! She loves to sit right above my head on the couch and lay on my pillow in my bed with me." We’re so happy for Elsa and her new mom!
