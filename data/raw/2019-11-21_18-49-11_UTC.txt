We still have a few spots open tonight for Yoga in the Cat Zone! With Thanksgiving right around the corner, it's the perfect time to carve out some space for yourself with mindful yoga and adorable cats. All you need is your mat, we'll provide the soothing feline energy. To reserve your spot, go to bit.ly/catttownreserve
