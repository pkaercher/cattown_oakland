CHALLENGE MATCH! A generous donor has asked us to raise $75,000 by December 31, and if we can, theyâ€™ll match every dollar. Will you help us rise to the challenge?

This year, Oakland Animal Services, the city shelter, received more cats than ever â€” and we took in more cats than any other organization. We focused on the cats who were struggling the most, helping cats like Clint, Clovis, and Coco, who had ringworm, kittens like Dr. Wendy and Holden, who were too old to socialize from a cage, and senior cats like Waffles who were depressed about no longer living in a home. Weâ€™re a small organization, but by giving these cats a second chance, we do work others believe is impossible, and we show organizations all over the country how they can do the same.

With this challenge, your donations will go twice as far, and do even more good. This is a rare opportunity to make a huge impact for the cats who are so frequently passed over at the shelter. Please make a gift today at cattownoakland.org/donate, and thank you, as always, for your incredible support! ðŸ“· of Wilbur and Orville by @marieluiseklotz
