We found a foster for Wonder! Thanks to you, we found just the right place for her to go while we figure out what's going on with this sweet lady. The first stop after the shelter was our vet, where she got a thorough exam. We've already ruled out more serious medical conditions such as toxoplasmosis, and are getting some more blood work done. The next stop was the foster home, where this friendly girl is settling in nicely and making friends with everyone! Your donations directly help cats like Wonder â€” because our donor-supported Emergency Medical Fund allows us to give her the medical care she needs. Thank you to everyone who supports our work!
