Etta is ready and eager to accept any and all love that she can get! If you offer her pets, she'll be content for hours, sitting right by your side. She's a sweet cat who became increasingly stressed the longer she had to stay at the shelter. Etta is doing much better in a foster home, where she is happy to receive all the love, and play to her hearts content. If you think you can give Etta the affection and attention she deserves, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet her.
