As we near the end of Adopt a Senior Pet Month, we're thinking of our many wonderful senior cats looking to find their home! One of them is 11-year-old Boots. She might be a senior,  but she's ready to be your new best friend and shadow. She loves following people around and “doing” things with them. And when she’s not joining you in every activity, she’s accepting lots of pets and will return the favor with some headbutts. Her foster raves about her adorable range of sounds, whether they be meows, purrs, or chirps — Boots has got it all. Helping older cats is core to our work, because after a lifetime of living in a home, these cats don't do well in a cage. That's why we started our "In It For Life" program, where we cover the medical bills of senior cats for the rest of their life. So if you have a Boots-shaped hole in your life, medical bills don't have to be an obstacle for adoption — consider bringing this calm and sweet senior into your home. To meet Boots, email us at info@cattownoakland.org.
