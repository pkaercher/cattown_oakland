Newt is adopted â€” we're so happy to see this wonderful girl move on to the next chapter in her life! After her spay surgery, Newt was not eating and losing weight at the shelter. We brought her to our Adoption Center where she was able to put on some weight in a calm and less stressful environment. Not long after, her adopters saw Newt on our website and fell in love with her. They came to visit her in person, and it was truly love at first site! We're glad to have been a part of Newt's journey, and see her find her family. Thank you for making it possible for us to help cats like Newt!
