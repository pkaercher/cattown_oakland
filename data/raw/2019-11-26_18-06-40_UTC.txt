Meet Violet! This pretty girl is a very sweet and social cat who would love nothing more than to spend time with you. If there’s a book you’ve been meaning to read or a show you’ve been meaning to binge, Violet is happy to sit close by. Violet previously lived outside, and after raising a litter of 7 kittens, she's ready for some me time. One of her favorite things to do is running around with a toy — she can entertain herself for hours that way. But she's equally happy to tag along with whatever you're doing, too. Violet enjoys being petted, but she is still learning the joys of sitting on a human lap. She gets a little nervous about sudden movements, which is why she needs an adopter who will be patient with her as she settles into a new home. If you'd like to bring Violet home for the holidays, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet this friendly girl!
