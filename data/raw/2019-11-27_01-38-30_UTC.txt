Giving Tuesday is the perfect day to kick off the holidays as a time to do good, and it's right around the corner â€” just one week from today! We hope you'll keep Cat Town in mind on this day of giving. If we can raise $75,000 by December 31, every dollar will be matched by an anonymous donor. This means your generosity will go twice as far on Giving Tuesday. So far, with your help, we've raised $8,000 to help vulnerable shelter cats! If you'd rather get in the holiday spirit early, you can make a gift at cattownoakland.org/donate today.
