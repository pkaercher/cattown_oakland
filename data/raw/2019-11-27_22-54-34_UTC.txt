#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Earlier this year, we dipped into our Emergency Medical Fund to help Tammy, a cat who got caught in a car engine. You can read about her road to recovery here on our blog bit.ly/cattownblogtammy. These days, Tammy goes by Birdy and is doing better than ever! Her adopter writes, "I still can’t believe how lucky I have been to have Birdy in my life. She is the sweetest cat I’ve ever met. She loves food, sleeping and cuddles, and gives high-fives on command. She will readily accept any kind of love you’re offering her, and she’s a very sweet big sister to her little brother, Blixa. Her favorite toy is her little red laser dot that she chases around the house. She is darling, I can’t begin to thank Cat Town enough for what you all did for her. She is so deserving of the second chance you gave her. I don’t know what we did without her. She is the most perfect family member." Thanks to everyone who helped us give her a second chance earlier this year! Your donations all year long help cats like Tammy recover from serious injuries and get adopted.
