Want an affectionate mini lion to greet you at your front door when you arrive home? If you're intrigued, you should meet Spike! This affectionate companion is looking for a perfect home to come home to for the holidays. He was at the shelter for two months, but feeling frustrated by the cage â€” so we brought him to a foster home. To meet Spike, send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org.
