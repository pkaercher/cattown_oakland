Here's the impact YOU'VE MADE this year:
.
22 of the 65 senior cats we helped can have their medical care covered for life! 
54 black cats got a chance to be someone’s good luck buddy! 
68 hissy kittens aged 4+ months, normally considered "too old" to help, learned to be brave cats! 
101 sick or injured cats received surgery, medicine, dental work, or life-saving diagnostics! !
107 cats got to stay with their best friends, because we make sure not to break up bonded pairs (or trios!)
And so! Much! More!
.
Each of these cats needed someone to take a chance on them, each had a life worth living, and each was saved, thanks to your support. We can't do our work without your help spreading the word for fosters, making donations, and volunteering. Thank you for being the best community we could ever ask for — and Happy Thanksgiving!
