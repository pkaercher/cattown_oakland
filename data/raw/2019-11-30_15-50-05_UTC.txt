"Boba came into my life in a time where I was at my lowest. He was definitely part of a new chapter in my life and I couldn’t have made it through without him. We needed each other to survive a difficult time in our lives, and through it all became a family." Those are the heartwarming words of Jackie, Boba's adopter (fka Daryl).

When Boba was at the shelter he was feeling quite conflicted — one moment he’d lunge at passersby, then the next he would be flirty, rubbing on bars. One time he even bit someone. Despite this, we brought him to Cat Town. We knew he needed to get into a real home to feel like himself again, and fortunately, Boba found some incredible adopters who wanted to take a chance on him.
