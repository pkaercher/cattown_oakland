What makes Guinevere happy? Speak softly to her, and she will start purring, making biscuits and slowly blink as she settles deeper and deeper into a state of zen. She's looking for a family to spend the holidays with (and many, many years to come) â€” bring her home and she'll fill your house with chirps and purrs! We think Gwen would likely enjoy the company of another cat as she continues to grow her confidence around humans. If you're considering bringing this gentle and loving cat into your home, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet Gwen!
