Adopted! Ricotta and Moira came from two separate litters of 4 older kittens. At our Adoption Center, we put all 8 of them together so they could build confidence and learn from each other. The 8 Forgotten Kittens were in one large studio space together â€” there they all became fast friends, and learned how to be brave from their daily interactions with our volunteers and visitors. That's where Ricotta and Moira found their family, or rather, stole the hearts of their humans. Congrats to Ricotta and Moira, and the happy family!
