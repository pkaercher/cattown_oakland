Until midnight tonight, all donations, up to $10K, will be TRIPLED for a total of $30K to Cat Town â€” with a chance to be QUADRUPLED if you give through our Facebook Fundraiser!  With so much at stake, we wanted to know: what does Cat Town mean for the people who love our cats?
.
To some, it's magic. To others, it's a promise. And it's always a place where every cat is treated like family. Your donations make it possible for us to treat each cat like an individual, meet them where they are, and help them on their journey home. Please consider a gift today to support every cat who turns to us for help, and to make more families this holiday season. www.cattownoakland.org/donate
