We did it! Thanks to you we secured our ENTIRE bonus $10K match, qualified for even more match from Facebook, and got even closer to hitting our $75,000 goal by December 31. This funding will help ensure we have all the supplies we need to give Forgotten Kittens the chance they deserve â€” and gets us closer to reaching our $75,000 challenge goal by the end of the year. We're so grateful for all you do to help our cats!
