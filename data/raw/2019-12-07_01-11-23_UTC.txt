#ForgottenKittenFriday: Meet Lorelei! She and her sister Jupiter are new to Cat Town. As part of our Forgotten Kitten Project, Lorelei and Jupiter are currently still building their trust with humans. Thanks to your support, we're able to give them the time to adapt at their own pace, and help them get a little more brave every day. They're not ready for visits from the public just yet, but our volunteers and staff are working with them to help them build their confidence.
