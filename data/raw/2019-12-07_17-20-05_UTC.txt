Up for a game of hide and seek? Adorable Avery is your girl! She will disappear to mysterious places, and then all of a sudden show up! And with that, she has earned herself the nickname “Houdini.” At the shelter, Avery was feeling very stressed in a cage, unable to be herself and relax — that's why it's especially wonderful to see her playful and sweet side come out in a foster home. This 3-year-old sweetheart is independent, but also very affectionate. She will let you in for the cuddle, a BIG cuddle. When she wants pets, she’ll actively seek your hand and do a little hop in the air with her front paws. If she's laying down while you’re offering affection, she’ll show her appreciation by blissfully rolling around. If you're interested in adopting this special girl, email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
