Adopted! Jack came to Cat Town with his three (cheese) siblings Gouda, Ricotta and Manchego. Jack was the most confident of the shy litter, and of the four, he was the first to find his home â€” and boy did he find himself a family! He went home to a big house in San Francisco with not only a human family, but also a 2-year-old cat and an older dog. Congrats Jack on hitting the jackpot!
