"One day, they push past their fear, too, and take a chance on giving us their trust. They make a leap of faith, hoping we’ll do what we always do, and treat them gently. And we do. In an instant, they realize it’s all we will ever do. They finally feel safe. They become snuggly kittens."
— Marie Carney, Maddie's Medical Manager

Dr. Wendy and Holden are doing so well at our Adoption Center! These two forgotten kittens were in foster with our Medical Manager Marie — they came to her when they were 20 weeks old. They started off frightened, and would run and hide whenever Marie entered the room. Over time Dr. Wendy and Holden learned to enjoy pets, and even slept in bed with Marie all night. Now the two are at our Adoption Center, ready to find their family! To read more about frightened kittens and their journey of becoming brave, go to bit.ly/triplekittens
