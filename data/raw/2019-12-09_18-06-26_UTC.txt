If you're still looking for the perfect holiday gift, look no further! Give the gift of cat inspired attire and accessories, all while knowing that your gift giving helps Oakland's most vulnerable cats! We have new designs in our shop by local artists @scary4cat @kneesandkeysart @ekke_art and @eykansaku decorating everything from shirts to totes to mugs. Every purchase you make helps a forgotten kitten build their confidence, a senior get a second chance at finding love, or gets a stressed cat out of a cage.
