In November we celebrated some fabulous adoptions! Bunny, whoâ€™d been waiting too long in a cage, met her match in less than a week at our Adoption Center. Stressed cats like Pearl could relax, and one of our volunteers fell in love with her for exactly who she is when she feels her best. And senior Betty finally found a home where she can get belly rubs all day long. You can see every cat who went home last month in our adoption round-up! bit.ly/cattownnovember2019
