Meet our Cat of the Month, Luneau! She's a budding scientist looking for her next great discovery: someone to play and snuggle with. This sweet and stunning tuxedo is a toy expert and has a PhD in laptime, but prefers to gather data before jumping to any conclusions in her relationships. So far she has learned that she loves to be near people, and will follow you around to ensure you both get some quality time together. If you want to help this young cat discover true love, ask about meeting the lovely Luneau by emailing info@cattownoakland.org
