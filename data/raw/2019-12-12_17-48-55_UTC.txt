When Wonder arrived at the shelter she seemed healthy, but quickly became a medical mystery. At the shelter, treatment for toxoplasma gondii did not improve her condition. Wonder was out of options — so, we stepped in. After visiting our vet, we have ruled out cerebellar hypoplasia and rabies, and have a treatment plan for what we believe is a severe infection affecting Wonder’s sense of balance.

Donations today up to $10,000 will be tripled to help us give Wonder the treatment she needs, and to help other cats like her who need medical care that goes above and beyond. Your generosity today can help hundreds more cats, all year long! We want to give this wonderful girl the best life possible. Wonder is a special cat. By supporting Cat Town, you become part of her story, and part of her journey of recovery.
