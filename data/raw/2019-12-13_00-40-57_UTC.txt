TRIPLE MATCH ALERT! Wonder loves everyone she meets. Shortly after coming to the shelter, she became disoriented â€” she was wobbly and weaving, walking in circles, but always towards the nearest human. The shelter was out of options, so we took her in, and are helping her recover. But we can't do it without you!

For just 24 hours a donor is matching your donations up to $10,000, and we're one third of the way there! Will you help us spread the word about this challenge by telling 2 friends?
.
Your donation will help support Wonder and other cats with medical challenges. When you support Cat Town, you become part of Wonder's story. You are the foster home. You are the test and vet exams. You are the medication to help her recover. You are her warm bed at night. Because without you, none of this would be possible. Help us meet our goal so we can help Wonder and cats like her! www.cattownoakland.org/donate
