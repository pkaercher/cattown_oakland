Yesterday we were challenged to raise $10,000 in 24 hours â€” no small feat. Thanks to your generosity, we raised more than $5,000 to help Wonder and more cats with medical needs get the care they deserve! Since we didn't reach our 24-hour goal, we have to offer the match funds back to the donor who challenged us, but we DID put a good dent in our end-of year challenge to raise $75,000. And as of today are 80% toward that goal! Thank you for everything you do to help our cats! You can still give today and throughout the end of the year, and have your donations doubled to help cats in need.
