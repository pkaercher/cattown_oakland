Cyan is ready to make some new friends! This beautiful boy was feeling quite stressed at the shelter, so we brought him to a foster home. He's been settling in splendidly, and now he's ready to meet his family. Cyan has a lot going for him, and one of those things is that he is a professional air-biscuit-maker. If you're interested in adopting Cyan, email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
