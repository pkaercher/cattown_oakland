We recently shared Luneau as our Cat of the Month, but that sweet girl was adopted only 10 days into the month! Luckily we have so many incredible cats deserving of the spotlight — and deserving of your love.
.
Meet our Cats of the Months 2.0: Bonded sisters Marilyn Monroe and Ginger Rogers — they are the perfect holiday treat! As gentle and sweet seniors, being brushed, tummy rubs and lap time are all in their repertoire of things they adore. Marilyn Monroe, ever the fan of cuddling up for some cheek scritches, will melt in your hands. Ginger Rogers, like her namesake, will easily dance her way into your heart with her gentle disposition. They gals are so ready to live out their best years with you! Interested? Don't hestitate to reach out to meet these special senior ladies. Email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
