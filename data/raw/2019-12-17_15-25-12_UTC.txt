Watson and Cricket are wondering why they haven't gotten more attention from potential adopters. After all, they've made some important discoveries and conducted studies that should have earned them international acclaim. Not only did they retrieve a tooth brush (believed by some to be lost long ago), but they also notified their humans of this discovery with cute looks and loud, deep purrs. Other work includes studies on the best cat toy ever invented (using a control group for accuracy, of course), and which string of meow sounds will result in the most amount of treats. They're still working on getting their new work published in a paper, but in the meantime, maybe they'll discover their forever home? If you're interested in adopting these two master minds, send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org.
