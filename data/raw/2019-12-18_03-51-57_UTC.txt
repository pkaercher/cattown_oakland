In November we shared some of our favorite adoption stories of the year with you. Today, we’re sharing three more staff favorites, which you can see at bit.ly/whoyousaved
.
One of the staff pick's is Button, who came to Cat Town with some serious medical problems. "Over time, and with a lot of work from her foster, our vet team, and Cat Town staff, although not ideal, all of Button’s health issues became manageable. Button got adopted within a month of us making her available and now she is thriving in her new home. Her person let us know she spends her days happily ‘going back and forth between cuddles with her new person and her food dish!’ All the hard work and chances we take at Cat Town feel worth it when I can remember stories like this.”
— Marie Carney, Maddie's Medical Manager

Every day we are so grateful for you — you make it all possible for us to help the cats who need us most. Thank you for making sure all of our cats get to have a happily-ever-afters. Thank you for helping us find them their perfect family!
