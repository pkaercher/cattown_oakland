When you donate to Cat Town, you become the teacher for a kitten learning to be brave. You become the medicine to get a sick cat back on her feet. You become a warm, soft bed for a senior cat to nap in. You become a path forward, and a way home. When you donate to Cat Town, you become the hero a shelter cat has waited for. Your generosity today can make a huge difference for our cats â€” in so many wonderful ways.
