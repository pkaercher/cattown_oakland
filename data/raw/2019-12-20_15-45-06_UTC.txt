"Tony looks tough, but is a sweet and loving cat. He sneezes and drools all the time, but he makes up for always being damp with his goofy nature. He and Ollie have become buddies, which is exactly what I hoped for."
— Jennifer, Adopter of Cat Town cats Bruno, Ollie and Tony
.
When Jennifer met Bruno, her first Cat Town cat, it was love at first sight. He had been in a cage for 7 years at another rescue,  and while Bruno didn't have much time with her, he changed Jennifer's life forever — and in turn helped two more cats, including Tony.
