Suzuki is adopted! This young girl came to the shelter with kittens, and then had to wait too long to find her family — she was constantly being overlooked, and that although she's pretty much perfect! We brought her to our Adoption Center where she charmed visitors left and right with her confident energy and adorable chirps. And she was adopted in no time — 5 days to be exact. We're so happy she found her family. Congrats Suzuki!
