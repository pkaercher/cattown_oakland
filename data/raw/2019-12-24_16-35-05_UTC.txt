Wilbur might not only have the softest fur of any cat you'll ever meet, he's also a total charmer! His sidekick (and brother) Orville is often nearby, and the two can frequently be observed laying in a puddle of cuddles and love. Come by our Adoption Center when we reopen on the 26th to meet Forgotten Kittens Wilbur and Orville!
