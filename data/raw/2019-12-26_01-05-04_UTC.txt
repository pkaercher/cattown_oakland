Love isn't always easy â€” and sometimes, you might wonder if you're the right person for someone you care for. When Vanessa brought 12-year-old Bobbie home, she certainly didn't always feel certain that she could be the person Bobbie needed her to be. But she didn't give up. She kept trying, and in doing so, she discovered a love that changed her life. Your support helped bring these two together, so we hope you'll read their story today on our blog! bit.ly/bobbieandvanessa
