Once a cat walks through Cat Town's doors, they're family. And since they are family, we promise to that cat that they never have to go back to a cage. When you donate to support our cats, you become part of that promise, too. You're the toy that helps a kitten see that they don't need to feel afraid. You're the cat carrier getting a cat safely to the vet. You're the special food a senior can't resist when nothing else seems to make them want to eat. You're the hope in the hearts of our staff and volunteers. Thank you! Your support makes our work possible.
