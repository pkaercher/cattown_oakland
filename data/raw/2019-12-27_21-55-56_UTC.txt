Becca and Bindi are ready to find a forever home! These sisters exemplify why we keep bonded pairs together: Becca is the more outgoing of the two, and helps shy Bindi feel safe when company visits. These girls love to play once they settle in, and will greet you at the door when you come home. We think Becca and Bindi would be happiest in a home with no other pets or young children. If you know someone who'd connect with these sensitive souls, please tell them about these Becca and Bindi â€” and if that person is you, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet these sweet sisters!
