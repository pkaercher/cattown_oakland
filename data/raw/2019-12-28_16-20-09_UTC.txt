Roger is an explorer! With his intelligence and independence —  and just 1.5 years old — he's got all the right qualifications for the job. He primarily explores boxes and bags, but once he gets to know you, he'll also follow you, inspecting everything nearby. Roger can be a little skittish, but this companionable cat makes up for it by being extremely cute. Roger needs a home where he will be intellectually stimulated and get some good physical workouts. If you like a good cat play session and need more cuteness in your life, Roger might be the one for you! Email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet him.
