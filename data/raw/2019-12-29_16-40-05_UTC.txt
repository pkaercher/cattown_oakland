Adopted! Reina was adopted by her foster, and is now the queen of the house! She's a warm and friendly monarch who loves cuddles. At 12 years old, Reina prefers to play in a leisurely manner, but she can't resist batting around her favorite wadded up ball of paper. It's one of her favorite toys, but if she sees you watching, she will insist on sharing, as any good ruler should â€” no wonder she stole her foster's heart. We're so happy that Reina was able to find her person so quickly!
