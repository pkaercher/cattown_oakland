TRIPLE MATCH! Between now and December 31, a donor is helping triple your donations, up to $20,000! EVEN BETTER: when you commit to becoming a new monthly donor, your entire first year of giving will be counted toward this challenge. That means a new $10/month donation becomes $240 for Cat Town today!
.
Your donations mean that when a shelter cat has a contagious disease, we can step in to treat them. When a scared kitten doesn't trust humans, we can teach them about love. When a senior cat lands in the shelter, we can make sure their golden years are full of joy and comfort. .
Will you help us spread the word and tell three friends about this incredible opportunity?
