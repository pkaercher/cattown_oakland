With just 2 days left in our $75,000 challenge, one of our donors has provided us an additional match challenge to help triple your gift, up to $20,000, between now and December 31!
.
When someone says a 4-month old, hissy kitten is too old to save, your support allows us to look past that kitten’s fear, and teach them to trust instead.
When a cat has been overlooked in a cage for months, and the shelter is running out of space, your donations let us tell them, “Come to Cat Town. You’ve got all the time you need.”
When a cat who had been faced with unusual hardships gets adopted, we follow up with their new family to continue offering support and advice. Because like you, even after they leave, we care what happens to our cats and their new families.
.
Your donation, today, can do three times the good. It's a comfort for a cat whose world has turned upside down — and their safe passage to a home full of love. Please donate at www.cattownoakland.org/donate.
