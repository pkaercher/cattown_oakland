As a senior lady, Emma is an experienced lovebug. She likes a  warm spot of sunlight, affectionate company, and a good head scratch. She’s a huge sweetheart who loves to be pet and doted on, and even enjoys spending time with other cat friends. Emma is very relaxed, and has learned that jumping isn't a big thing — perfect for homes with countertops that you don’t want your furry friends to visit. This adorable lady would do best in a loving home with someone with cat experience. If you want Emma's cuddles in your life, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet her.
