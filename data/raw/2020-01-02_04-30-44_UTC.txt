THANK YOU for helping us meet our match! What does it mean to unlock our $75K challenge grant? It means a way home for more stressed cats like Lilu. When we met Lilu at Oakland Animal Services this summer, she was so aggressive that staff had trouble cleaning the cage next to hers. Before arriving at the shelter, Lilu had lived in a home with another cat. After that cat died, she became depressed and less social, so she was surrendered. Terrified and overwhelmed, Lilu would attack the bars of her shelter cage whenever anyone came close. With all her familiar routines gone, she didn’t feel safe.
.
We brought Lilu to Cat Town, where she could feel safe again, and find comfort — and where she met her adopters less than a week later. Recently her adopters let us know Lilu is doing great. "As you can see, she is our real live teddy bear. She’s the cuddliest, fluffiest baby with a big loud purr. She’s a sweetheart, and we’re so lucky to have found her!"
.
We couldn't take a chance on cats like Lilu if we didn't know there were people like you out there who believed in our work, and that scared cats can transform when they feel safe. Thank you for helping us meet our match, for supporting Cat Town, and giving cats like Lilu a second chance! We couldn't do this work without our amazing community.
