Anansi wants to meet you! Like his namesake, he's been in the Cat Zone long enough to acquire all the wisdom and knowledge a cat must have. He's also a lovable and playful trickster, and knows a thing or to about chasing a wand toy. As a Forgotten Kitten, Anansi needs to go to a home with a confident resident cat, or be adopted with one of his friends from our Adoption Center. To meet this sweet, wise boy, come on over to Cat Town during our open hours!
