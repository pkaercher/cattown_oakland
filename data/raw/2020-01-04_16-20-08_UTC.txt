Bee Bee is adopted! When her adopter met Bee Bee, she fell hard for the sweet senior. Bee Bee has impaired vision, but that doesn't take away her zest for life. She's a purr machine, love bug and cuddle cat â€” we're so happy that these two found each other! Thank you for helping us give senior cats like Bee Bee that second chance to find a loving home.
