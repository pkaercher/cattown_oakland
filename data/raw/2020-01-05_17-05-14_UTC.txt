Who is this cute cat you ask? It's Bruno, aka "amazing purr machine". Offer him head pets or brush him, and he'll get started on the amazing wonderful sound of deep purrs. Bruno loves people â€” he is affectionate and super loving, even after everything he's been through. Most recently Bruno had a surgery on his hip, but he's recovered well, and is more ready than ever to find his new family! If you're ready to get swept off your feet by this sweet guy, send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org to meet Bruno!
