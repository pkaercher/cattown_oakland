Ra and Shams are looking for a new home! These beautiful orange tabby boys are everything you could want in a bonded feline pair. Sweet, affectionate, adorable, with a love for a warm lap and belly rubs. While they may take a moment to adjust to new people, they'll make up for it with kitty kisses and night cuddling. Currently in a foster home, you can meet these two by emailing us at info@cattownoakland.org â€” we have a feeling it could be love at first sight!
