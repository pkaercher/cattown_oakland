It's #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday! Foster cat Indy was adopted a couple months ago, and we recently got the most wonderful update: "We love our sweet kitty â€” she's so cozy and is obsessed with finding the source of the heating vent! I love when she curls up like a cinnamon bun and sleeps for hours. She seems happy and content. We renamed her Drita Davanzo (after the Mob Wife) because she likes to fight in the window with the neighbor cat, and she kind of looks like Drita, too. Her meow is super squeaky and adorable, and she sometimes will have a meow fest when we forget her evening treats." We're so glad this cinnamon bun has found her family! If you never want to miss another update from this adorable girl, follow her at @drita.vonhiss.
