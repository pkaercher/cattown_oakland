We have a very special story to share with you all: this holiday season we had our first surprise adoption! Celeste had been in foster for nearly one year, all the while wooing her foster parents with cuddles and purrs. Her foster mom taught her tricks, dutifully managed Celeste's hyperthyroidism ‚Äî and she was falling in love. She and her husband had agreed to adopt a dog for their first pet, but it was all too obvious that everyone wanted to keep this special girl. So Celeste's foster dad secretly reached out to us to quietly make it official. On Christmas day, Celeste's foster mom got the ultimate gift: the cat she'd grown to adore! It's the best kind of "foster fail" story, and we couldn't be happier for everyone involved. We're jumping with joy for this adoption, @ohsweetkitty!
