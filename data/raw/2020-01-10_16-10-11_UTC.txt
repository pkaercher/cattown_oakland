December was a good month to focus on family, friends, and togetherness â€” a good month to take a hiatus from exercise and mindfulness. But after the winter hiatus, Yoga and Meditation in the Cat Zone are back! We have not one, but two classes coming up just for you. Start the new decade off right by joining us for a Meditation class in the Cat Zone with instructor Jaene Leonard on January 23rd, and Mindful Yoga with cats on January 30th with yoga teacher @sarahwoodsladue. Reserve your spot at bit.ly/cattownreserve!
