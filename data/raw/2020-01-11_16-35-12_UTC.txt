Molly is a very special senior lady: she is the sweetest cat in town. She's a puddle of love. She will follow you everywhere. Her favorite thing is to have a luxurious brushing, and being treated like the princess that she is. Molly does have some special needs, but they can be easily managed by a responsible adopter â€” and she will flop over to show her appreciation for your undying love! To meet this bundle of sweetness, just send us an email to info@cattownoakland.org.
