Dr. Wendy and Holden are adopted! You may remember the two from our blog post in December (bit.ly/triplekittens). As older, fearful kittens, the young bonded pair was first fostered by Marie, Maddie's® Medical Manager, and then — once they pushed past their fear — the two came to our Adoption Center. Because they lived in a foster home and learned from more confident cats in the Cat Zone, they were able to feel safe, and find a loving home. They're already doing great with their new family! Thanks to you, we can continue to help cats like Holden and Dr. Wendy on their journey to feeling confident!
