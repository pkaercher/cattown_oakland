When cats that were once shy and hissy come to you, it’s nearly impossible to say no — sometimes Blaze requests to be held like a baby! He and his siblings are going to be available for adoption soon, and in the meantime you can visit them at our Adoption Center. We’ll be open again for you starting Wednesday — to reserve your spot in advance go to www.cattownoakland.org/reservations
