Can you foster for Cat Town? Ser Pounce was surrendered to the shelter by his guardian, and he's the absolute nicest cat. This sweet buddy has a lot of broken teeth, and will need to get quite a bit of dental work done. We'd like to find him a cozy foster home where he can decompress from vet visits and medical treatment. If you're up for helping out Ser Pounce, email us at info@cattownoakland.org to learn all about how easy fostering is!
