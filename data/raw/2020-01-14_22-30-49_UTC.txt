Look who's new at Cat Town â€” it's Chevy! At the shelter he spent a month hiding before he became curious and came out of his hiding spot. He slowly started engaging in play with volunteers, but would sometimes swat. Eventually, through dedicated time from volunteers, he starting allowing brief pets with only playful swats. To help him further decompress, we brought Chevy to Cat Town. He is quickly turning out to be an incredibly gentle and sweet bundle of love, who loves being pet, and will make "marching biscuits". Chevy will be available for adoption soon, and in the meantime you can come visit him in the Cat Zone!
