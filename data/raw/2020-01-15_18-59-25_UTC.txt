#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: David came to Cat Town as a Forgotten Kitten, and went home in November as a companion for a recently adopted kitten from @oaklandanimalservices. The little one, named Sue Bird, had a lot of energy and needed a feline friend to play and cuddle with! We recently got the latest on how things are going with the two, and it warmed our hearts. Their adopter says: "David absolutely loves to have his belly rubbed. He wriggles around on his back while you rub his belly. He sleeps with me every night and he is a really patient big brother to Sue. He helps her calm down and learn how to be less wild. He is incredibly sweet and gentle!" We're so happy for this #cattownalum and #oasalum pair!
