Heartbreak? Grief? Anxiety? Overwhelmed? Bring whatever weighs heavy on you to our gathering of cat lovers for a Meditation class at Cat Town on January 23. Led by instructor Jaene Leonard, weâ€™ll bond over felines and lighten things with a delicious body-sensing yoga nidra meditation in the presence of great fuzziness. Cats love the way the energy moves through the room. Sometimes they meditate with us, other times they run around... but theyâ€™re always curious. We have several spots open for our class next week â€” you can sign up now at bit.ly/cattownreserve (And yes, we'll break a few minutes early for playtime with cats!)
