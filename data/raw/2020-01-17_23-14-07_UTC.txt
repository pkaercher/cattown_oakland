Ringworm isnâ€™t life-threatening, but it's highly contagious and itchy. For many would-be adopters, that inconvenience is a deterrent, so cats with this athlete's foot-like rash often get euthanized in municipal shelters. Because we have space at our Adoption Center that allows even contagious cats to recover, Cat Town often intervenes to help these cats. So we were excited to hear that Austin Pets Alive! recently celebrated the grand opening of their brand new Maddieâ€™sÂ® Cat Adoption Center, helping more cats with ringworm find loving homes! Major kudos to @austinpetsalive and @maddiesfund for supporting overlooked cats! Read more at: bit.ly/petsaliveandmaddiesfund
