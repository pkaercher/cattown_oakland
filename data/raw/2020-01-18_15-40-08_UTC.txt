It takes a village to make Cat Town successful. We couldn't save lives without the contributions our volunteers and our community make every single day to keep things running smoothly. That's why we're launching a new series highlighting Cat Town's Unsung Heroes! Our very first Unsung Hero is Amy, a Cat Zone volunteer who helps fearful cats learn to trust humans through careful socialization. We currently have 5 cats with ringworm, which can be very contagious, so volunteers have to take an extra step and dress in protective gowns to visit these cats. This week, Amy suited up to spend hours visiting all of our ringworm cats! Her kindness helped make sure they continue to learn to be brave while they're in isolation, so that as soon as they're well, they can be adopted. Thank you, @minxcoke, you deserve a huge shout-out!
