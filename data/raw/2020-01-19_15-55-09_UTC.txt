"Then one evening I was scrolling through Instagram and saw Cat Town's latest post: a beautiful tabby named Sati was at OAS, massively stressed, and needed to get out ASAP. There was something about her that drew me in right away; I showed the post to Zack and he said without hesitating, 'You should ask about her.' His reaction was all I needed to reach out to Cat Town."
