Meet Chairwoman Meow and Pinky, adorable bonded sisters, who will seek each other out for comfort and play. They look like mirror images, one black and one grey, both with white chests and bellies. Chairwoman Meow and Pinky came to Cat Town as Forgotten Kittens, which means they needed some time to learn to be confident around humans â€” and they've come a long way thanks to their foster! They love playtime, but when that's over, they like to follow you around and settle in on or near your lap. If you're ready to bring a lot of joy and love into your home, you should consider meeting these two lovelies. Email us at info@cattownoakland.org!
