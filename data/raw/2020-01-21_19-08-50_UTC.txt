As many of you know, Cat Town was founded nine years ago by Ann Dunn. In that time, she has left an indelible mark on the world of animal welfare. Today, we announce some exciting news about Cat Townâ€™s future: after so many wonderful years building this organization, with the incredible support of Cat Townâ€™s staff, board of directors, volunteers, and you â€” our community, Ann is stepping down as executive director for Cat Town, effective today, to take the helm at @oaklandanimalservices in February. You can read more about this important transition, and what it means for our work to transform cat rescue nationwide, on our blog: bit.ly/cattownanndunn
