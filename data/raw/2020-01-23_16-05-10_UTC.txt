Yoda found his humans! He jumped on his adopters lap within 60 seconds of their arrival in his foster home â€” it must have been love at first sight. As a senior cat, and after staying at the shelter for a month, we knew we had to step in to help Yoda, and brought him to a foster home. Thanks to your support, we're able to give senior cats like a Yoda a second chance at finding a loving home!
