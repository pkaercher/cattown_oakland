What do KFC, possums, and Tomahawks all have in common? They tend to come into play when helping community cats, as bait and specialized trapping tools are both vital for getting the job done. Learn why, get tips on helping the cats in your own community, and receive hands-on training with a variety of traps in this free workshop on February 5, presented by @feralchange and Adam Myatt, @catmanofwestoakland. Any donations will support Feral Change and their work to manage Oakland's feral and homeless cat population. Sign up now at bit.ly/cattownreserve
