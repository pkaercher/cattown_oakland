Are you tired of boring toys that don't measure up to your cat's unique personality and talents? Join Cat Town and @rpscollective for a cat toy making workshop! Learn how to make pom poms, cat puzzles, toys that spring, and more â€” all from household and upcycled materials! All funds raised by this event will support Cat Town and our co-hosts, Rock Paper Scissors Collective. No experience needed, all ages are welcome to participate. All materials will be provided.
