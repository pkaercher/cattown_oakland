Our Unsung Hero this week is @zelda_with_a_k! Kelda donated a monitor to Cat Town that we're now able to use for presentations during meetings. Gone are the days of everyone crowding around one laptop, or trying to read a far away screen. It's little things like this that make Cat Town work more smoothly and efficiently, so thank you Kelda for donating a monitor to our office. You make our team's work easier! #cattownhero
