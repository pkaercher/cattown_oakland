It's #tongueouttuesday â€” the perfect day to introduce you to Aisha! This beautiful lady is ready to have a conversation with you: her foster mom says sheâ€™s a talkative cat, and if you say something to her, she meows right back. Aisha is also sweet and playful, and while she loves her toys, sheâ€™ll always make time to be near you. She will even snuggle with you at night! You might not see this adorable behavior right away, as Aisha will be a little skittish in a new home, but she'll adjust each day as she gets more comfortable in her new environment. To meet this companionable cat and learn more about her, go to cattownoakland.org/aisha or email info@cattownoakland.org.
