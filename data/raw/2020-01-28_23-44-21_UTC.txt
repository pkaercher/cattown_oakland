Olive and Chevy came to our Adoption Center independently of one another, but these two have become wonderful friends — Chevy has taken on the role of Olive's life coach! Olive had been in a foster home for quite some time, and when she had to move, we brought her to our Adoption Center to see if she would benefit from being around other cats. At first she was quite withdrawn and hiding a lot. It wasn’t until Chevy came along that she’s been opening up more bit by bit. He's been giving her a lot of comfort, and if he’s not accepting pets doing “marching biscuits”, he can be seen snuggled up with Olive. We’re currently giving the two some more time to confirm that they have bonded, in which case they would go to a home together!
