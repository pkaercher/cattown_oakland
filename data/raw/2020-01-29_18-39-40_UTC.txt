#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Maddie, named after our friends at @maddiesfund, was originally found in the @oaklandanimalservices parking lot by our Foster Coordinator Dawn. After 6 weeks at the shelter, we brought her to a foster home to decompress, and from there she was adopted in December! We recently got an update from her adopter, and we had to share it with you: "Just wanted to let you know that Maddie and I are doing very well! She seems very content here and she is just too cute. She loves sitting in my lap and sleeping on top of me when I'm sleeping." Hooray Maddie, and congratulations again to both her and her adopter!
