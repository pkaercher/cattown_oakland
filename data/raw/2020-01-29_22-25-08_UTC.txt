A Pep Talk for Poppy, by Quinn White:
Dear little Poppy, youâ€™ve truly blossomed at Cat Town, and youâ€™re ready for a home. Iâ€™m so proud of you! Youâ€™ve come so far from your first days here, when we discovered you had been hiding your injured tail at the shelter. It was bitten in three places infected, and caused you so much pain that all you could feel was fear. But Marie took you to the vet and got you all fixed up. Your tail healed, and now itâ€™s a badge that honors everything you overcame. You are so strong! Without the pain you had to live with for so long, youâ€™ve let down your walls, and learned to oh-so-carefully ask for affection. Remember the time Andrew was teaching a cat to high five, and you interrupted the lesson to lay your head in his hand?...
