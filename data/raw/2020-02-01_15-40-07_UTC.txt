Ring in the roaring 20's by fostering! Enzo needs a quiet, cat savvy guardian. He's feeling stressed at the shelter, and needs someone to show him how fantastic pets are. He enjoys it once it's happening, but just needs a little more TLC to adjust. Send us an email to info@cattownoakland.org today if you want to help Enzo by fostering him!
