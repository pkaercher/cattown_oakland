Our unsung hero this week is volunteer Carol S.! We had a last minute need to have supplies delivered to foster cats this weekend, and Carol jumped right in without any hesitation to help us out. She made sure that our foster cats all over town — such as sweet Serendipity pictured here — got the food and supplies they needed! Thank you, Carol, for being a superstar to Cat Town and our foster cats!
