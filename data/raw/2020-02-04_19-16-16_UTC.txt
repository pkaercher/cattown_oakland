Help celebrate Ann’s Cat Town legacy! After stepping down as Executive Director, our founder Ann Dunn is starting her new position as Director of Oakland Animal Services in just two weeks. In her own words, “It is a gift to me to know this organization that I love so much will be in such good hands with Andrew.” We’d like to give Ann another wonderful gift — one to show her that the Cat Town community is ready to carry on her legacy of innovation and compassion.
.
As Cat Town enters this new chapter, we’re renewing the promise Ann made 9 years ago to support every cat in need of a second chance. Will you join us with a donation today? Go to cattownoakland.org/donate to #leavealegacy for Ann!
