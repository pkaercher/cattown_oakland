This #WhereAreTheyNowWednesday we are checking in with #cattownalum Royce! "Things have been going well on the cat diplomacy front. Royce is so desperate to bond with Bodhi, and Bodhi doesn’t want us to know he secretly likes the attention.... it’s kinda cute! If I’m plugging away on my computer, and Bodhi thinks I’ve forgotten to pay attention to him, he’ll seek Royce out and play with him. The cats got some new toys for Christmas, including an automated laser dancer, which Royce is especially keen on." We hope Royce and @monsieur.bodhi continue to bond and become best friends!
