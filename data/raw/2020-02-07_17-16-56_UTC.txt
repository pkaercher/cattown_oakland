Buddy and Lucille are two cats that were in a foster home together, but didn't want anything to do with each other — since they were just peacefully coexisting and not bonded, we were happy to see Buddy be adopted in December. Lucille, still in her foster home, didn't like that change. She hid and was clearly missing Buddy whom she didn't show affection for before. Luckily for her, the adoption didn't stick, because Buddy and the resident cat weren't getting along. The moment Buddy came back to the foster home, Lucille stopped hiding, and now the two cats spend all their time together! As it sometimes goes in life, Lucille didn't know what she had until it was gone — with Buddy back, they realized they are the best of friends! And to top it all off, their foster decided to adopt the two in January after the happy reunion. Happy endings and new beginnings all around!
