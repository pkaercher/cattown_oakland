Have you met Astro? He has been described by one of our volunteers as a super smart and frustrated cat, similar to a kid in the wrong grade level. It's almost as if he throws little temper tantrums when he doesn't get what he wants, because he's bored. We are currently training this kitten in a grown cats body to learn appropriate behavior, because deep inside there's just a playful cat looking for love â€” we want to help him become the great cat he truly is! If Astro sounds like your kind of cat and you want to be his extracurricular tutor, stay tuned for when this fluffy fellow becomes available for adoption.
