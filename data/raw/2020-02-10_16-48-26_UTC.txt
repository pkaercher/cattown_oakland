Our unsung hero this week is Caskey Weston, volunteer and adopter of #cattownalum Autumn (now Hazel)! This past week @caskeypaints did the back-breaking work of lying on her side, on an incline, and painting names onto our mural to honor beloved cats and humans. She even went the extra mile and touched up a big scratch on one of the cats' eyes, so that you'd never know it had been damaged! Thank you, Caskey, for helping us out with your artistic talents!
