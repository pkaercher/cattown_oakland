Putu has never met a stranger she didn’t love —  she is just as sweet as the rice cake for which she's named! Her favorite place to sit? Wherever you are. Where is she when you get home? Waiting at the front door for you. What kind of cat is she? Putu is a velcro kitty. Since she's a senior, Putu spends a good amount of time resting, and she needs a guardian who will help her stay healthy with a special diet — but she has tons of cuddles and love to give as a thank you! To learn more about Putu, go to cattownoakland.org/putu, or just send us an email at info@cattownoakland.org to meet her.
