Happy Valentine's Day, Cookie! You are so ready to find your person and be adopted ‚Äì go girl! Show everyone your cat charisma! It‚Äôs been quite the journey since you were first found ‚Äútrying to board the train‚Äù at the West Oakland BART station. When you first arrived at Cat Town you were pretty shy, but volunteers and guests alike soon found that if we could sneak a pet, you‚Äôd lean in for more. Everyone who met you quickly learned that you loved a good chin scratch, but you also enjoy listening to classical music, and discussing weekend plans. Who knew you had so many hobbies? Cookie, the time is near when your ability to befriend any cat, soothingly calm demeanor, and beautiful tuxedo looks will lead to being adopted.
