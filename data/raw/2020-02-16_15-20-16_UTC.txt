Just like their Sesame Street namesakes, Bert and Ernie are a fun-loving, goofy pair of cats! They are silly, yet very intelligent.  They are shy, but also incredibly sweet. Bert is an affectionate boy who is described as a ‘purr-monster.’ Thankfully, he isn’t a monster at all. He will be your little shadow and loves attention. He gives gentle head butts and will even put his head in your hand for extra love. Ernie is a “foodie” and loves his treats. He’ll be your BFF if you sneak him a treat every now and again. Ernie is described as a very sweet and very handsome boy who loves his toys. His favorites are the wand toys that fly or swim through the air!
