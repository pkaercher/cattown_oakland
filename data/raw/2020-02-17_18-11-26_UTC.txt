This week's unsung hero is Mae L. â€” for weeks on end she has been coming in to help us treat our ringworm cats! That means coming to our Adoption Center every week, putting on a protective gown, and helping our staff dip the cats. Thanks to Mae's generosity and commitment, almost all of the cats have been cleared of ringworm! Right now only sweet Jameela (pictured here) is still being treated, but we hope to be able to clear her very soon. Thank you, Mae, for being a #cattownhero!
