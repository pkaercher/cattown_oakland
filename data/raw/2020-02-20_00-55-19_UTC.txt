#WhereAreTheyNowWednesday: Former foster cat Prometheus went home just in time for the Holidays in December, and boy does he love his new family! His adopter let us know that "He's a sweetie when he is relaxed and has gotten all of his energy out. At times, he can still seem like a kitten with his playful personality! I think it's safe to say that Promo (his nickname) will be a purrr-manent member of the family!" Hooray for Promo!
