Back in December we told you about Wonder, a cat who is nothing but sweetness and loves getting pets and having humans near. Wonder has some medical considerations: her head wobbles and weaves when she walks, so she has trouble keeping her balance. After ruling out several possible causes, such as cerebellar hypoplasia, we brought her to a neurologist to see what else we could do for this sweet girl. While the neurologist couldn't give a conclusive diagnosis, here's what we do know: Wonder has pain in her hind area, which is easily managed with inexpensive pain medication. Her wobbly head movements are likely some kind of vestibular (inner/middle ear) condition, which could be the result of an injury, birth defect or collected mucus deep in middle ear. There's a chance that, with an expensive MRI and spinal tap, we could learn whether this is treatable â€” but Wonder is stable and content, and can have a happy life "as is". With this bright prognosis, she's now ready to find her home! Thank you to everyone who supported our request to help us step in for this sweet girl. Because of you, we were able to give Wonder a safe place to land to make sure she got the care she needed.
