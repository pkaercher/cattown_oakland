Foster needed! Kevin is 7 years old, and needs a quiet home with a cat savvy foster. He is pretty shut down, so being around someone who can help him decompress and feel safe is important for this gentle boy. If you think you can help Kevin, send us an email to info@cattownoakland.org. We'll deliver him and all of the supplies, as well as give you any support and guidance you need!
