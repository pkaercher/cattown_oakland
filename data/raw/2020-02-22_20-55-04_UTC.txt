Adopted! After being at the shelter for nearly two months, we brought beautiful Sphinx to our Adoption Center. She spent most of her time in the Quiet Zone, decompressing from her shelter stay â€” and then got herself adopted in just two weeks! Sphinx is the classic example of a cat just needing to be in the right space to find her people, and we're delighted that she found her home so soon after coming to Cat Town's cage free Adoption Center!
