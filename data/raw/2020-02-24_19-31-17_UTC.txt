Our unsung hero this week is @sarahwoodsladue! Sarah teaches Mindful Yoga at Cat Town, volunteering her time and expertise to lead the class. Because of her, our guests can practice Yoga in a room full of cats, and our cats get to experience the calming energy of yogis in the room. Thank you, Sarah, for being a #cattownhero! We're so grateful for your generous contribution to our community!
