Today is World Spay Day! Is your pet spayed/neutered? If not, it's a good time to think about gettting them fixed. Spaying/neutering your pet is a proven way of saving the lives of companion animals and community cats, preventing shelters from getting overcrowded, and helping ensure that fewer animals are suffering on the street. If cost is a concern, many communities have free or afforable spay/neuter programs. One such resource here in the East Bay is @fix_our_ferals â€” check out their page for more information!
