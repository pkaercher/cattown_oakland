Do you sometimes wish you could save ALL the cats? So do we. Thatâ€™s why we love monthly donors! When you commit to making a monthly gift, we know we can count on your support. Having predictable income means we can stretch that much further to save one more cat who needs us, making monthly giving one of the most effective ways to support Cat Town. Our monthly supporters enjoy special monthly emails with adoption stories we donâ€™t share on our blog or social media, and we have special events just for them. Want to help Cat Town all year long and get the inside scoop on the cats youâ€™re helping? Become a monthly donor today at bit.ly/cattownmonthly
