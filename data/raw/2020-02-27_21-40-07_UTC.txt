Will you be a lifeline for these cats? A group of approximately 20 cats who had been living in an overcrowded, one-bedroom apartment were surrendered to the shelter. Like most animals in hoarding situations, they're frozen and shut down. Many have stopped eating due to stress. They need help learning how to build healthy relationships with humans â€” work that can't be done from a cage. For these cats, Cat Town is the only option for a bright future, but to help them, we need your support. Will you help us raise $10,000 to give these cats their best chance at recovery? With your support, we will give them all the time they need to decompress and realize they're safe. Please consider making a donation, and telling three friends about these cats!
