Adopted! Forgotten Kittens Chairwoman Meow and Pinky were in a foster home for two months before coming to our Adoption Center. In their foster home they learned what it meant to be brave, and here at Cat Town, that experience was solidified through positive interactions with visitors and volunteers. Now these two have found a loving home â€” a happy ending and beginning we never get tired of seeing. Thank you for making these stories happen by supporting Cat Town!
