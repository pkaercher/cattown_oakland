You all are amazing! On Thursday we asked for your help in giving a group of 20 cats a chance to feel safe and decompress. In just a couple days, your donations got us 80% of the way there. We're so close to raising what we need to help them all. Will you help spread the word to get us all the way to our goal?

This group of cats had been living in a single, one-bedroom apartment, and like most animals in these situations, they're frozen and shut down. They're docile and gentle, but completely terrified â€” and Cat Town their only chance at a brighter future. We need to raise $10,000 to cover their medical care, give them food and shelter, and provide them the enrichment that's been lacking in their life for so long. Your support today can make all the difference for these cats!
