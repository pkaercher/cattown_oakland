All of Gouda's cheese cat siblings have found happy homes â€” this wonderful fellow is still waiting to find that special human connection, along with his bonded sister from another mister Alexis. You can meet the two Forgotten Kittens at our Adoption Center! We're open until 7pm today and from 10am to 5pm on Sunday.
