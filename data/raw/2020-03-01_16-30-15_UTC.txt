Every once in awhile a cat comes along that has everything you've ever dreamed of — Stella is just such a cat! This sweet lady not only has a limitless desire to be petted, she also has an impressive purr, an adorable scratchy meow, extremely soft Russian Blue fur, and she's also super smart and playful. Stella’s very limited vision can make her a little nervous in new situations with new people. You’ll need patience to earn her trust and to develop your own communication style. Tapping on the floor to draw her attention works well to help Stella out, and so does talking a lot to help locate her. Once Stella knows you, she is a snuggly lap cat, joining you on the couch or bed, and she'll greet you at the door when you come home. If Stella sounds irresistible to you, then we encourage you to email us at info@cattownoakland.org to meet her! She might just be your cat.
