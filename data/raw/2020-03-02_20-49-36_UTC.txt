Our unsung hero this week is @jjaene! Not only does Jaene teach our meditation classes at Cat Town, she also recently dropped in to volunteer in the Cat Zone when she saw we had no volunteer coverage. We rely heavily on help from volunteers to let in visitors and guide our guests' experience — this helps our small staff focus on their day to day job duties. Thank you, Jaene, for jumping in when we needed help, and for giving our guests relaxing experiences through iRest meditation classes! You’re a #cattownhero!
