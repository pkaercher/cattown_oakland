Thank you, thank you, thank you! In just a few days you helped us raise over $9000, getting us 90% towards our goal. Every dollar helps us give these cats the care and love they need! Thanks to you, we can be a lifeline for these frozen, shut down cats. We've started bringing them to our Adoption Center, and our volunteers are already working to build their confidence and help them feel safe. We couldn't do this work without your unwavering support!
