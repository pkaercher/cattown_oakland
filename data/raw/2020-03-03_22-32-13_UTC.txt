FOSTER NEEDED! Kevin is quite scared, and has been hiding under the bed for much of the time since he got out of a cage. But once he feels safe, this gentle fellow is sweet and accepting of pets. Kevin needs a foster who has experience with scared and nervous cats â€” he would benefit from someone who lives a very quiet lifestyle, and has the time to work with him in order to gain his trust. We need to move Kevin to a new foster home by March 15, so if you can help, send us an email to info@cattownoakland.org!
